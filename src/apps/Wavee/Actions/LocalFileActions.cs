// Two gestures, one path: pick a file from the profile menu, or drop one on the window. Both build a synthetic Track
// (LocalPlayables) and hand it to the SAME no-hydration verb every other "play this exact track" call site uses —
// IPlaybackPlayer.PlayTrackAsync(Track) — which is the whole point of the source-agnostic seam: no new play path.
//
// A dropped .mp4 takes one extra step first: it attaches to its own generic playable as that playable's video override,
// through VideoActions.Apply (the ONE attach entry point — validate, persist, toast-undo). That is what makes it play
// WITH its embedded audio: the override machinery routes the playable to the video host, which is the only host that
// can pump an mp4's audio (a mounted surface drives the MF session — the invariant P2 documented).

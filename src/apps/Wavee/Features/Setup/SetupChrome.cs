/// settings row) since this component owns the session's lifetime;</item>
/// <item>continuing a first-run wizard that was still pending when auth completed — <see cref="SetupGating.IsPending"/>,
/// checked ONCE at mount. <c>WaveeShell</c> (and this chrome with it) only (re)mounts on an auth flip, so a
/// mount-time check exactly answers "did the wizard start pre-auth, in <c>SetupPreAuthRoot</c>, and not finish

/// </list>
/// Mounted inside <c>WaveeShell</c>'s <c>shellWithOverlays</c> ZStack, next to <c>SidebarOnboardingChrome</c>, so

/// An in-window, draggable + resizable picture-in-picture video surface. It floats over the shell (a top-Z, pass-through
/// overlay layer), anchored bottom-right by default, and hosts the SHARED <see cref="PopOutVideoStage"/>, which PRESENTS the
/// engine <c>MediaPlayer</c> owned by <c>FluentVideoMediaHost</c> (<see cref="PlaybackBridge.VideoPlayer"/>) for the resolved
/// <see cref="PopOutVideoSource"/>. NO surface builds a player — that ownership inversion is what keeps a placement move from
/// restarting the video from 0 and what makes the video's soundtrack the app's ONE current media.
/// Video composites here because the stage's <c>MediaPlayerElement</c> uses the PRIMARY window's AppHost registry (the
/// PiP lives INSIDE the main scene). Mutually exclusive with the detached pop-out window (exactly ONE mounted surface may
/// pump a given player). Visibility is derived: it mounts iff <see cref="PlaybackBridge.VideoPlacementNow"/> resolves
/// to <see cref="SurfacePlacement.Floating"/> — the ONE placement value, never a standalone flag. While it sits at its
/// default anchor it RESERVES layout (<see cref="PlaybackBridge.FloatingSurfaceReserve"/>) so it cannot cover page
/// content; dragging or resizing it releases the reservation, because placing it deliberately is the user opting into
/// a free-floating overlay.
///
/// CHROME (the WinUI compact-overlay read): there is NO permanent title bar — the video fills the whole rounded card, and
/// a slim <see cref="Tok.ScrimTop"/> strip carrying the ✕ HOVER-REVEALS over it. The reveal is declarative, not stateful:
/// the strip is <c>Opacity = 0, HoverOpacity = 1</c> and the engine cascades the CARD's hover onto it (a container reads as
/// hovered while the pointer is anywhere in its subtree, and reveal-affordance descendants follow — SceneRecorder
/// ResolveOpacity / AnimEngine.SetHoverDescendants). That costs no signal, no re-render, and no per-frame work; the card
/// earns its container status with a no-op <c>OnPointerExit</c> (the TrackRow / DetailTracks idiom — the handler exists to
/// register PointerBit, nothing else).
///
/// Drag/resize follow the SidebarResizeGrip idiom: BoxEl.OnDrag uses the engine's eager pointer capture, so the gesture
/// keeps firing as the pointer leaves the thin band; because the bands MOVE with the surface, the true window-space
/// pointer position is reconstructed each move as <c>local + scene.AbsoluteRect(handle)</c>. The surface is positioned
/// by a compositor-only <c>Transform</c> translation (layout stays put; only the paint/hit-test rect moves). Resizing is
/// eight-zone (four thin edge bands + four corners) via ONE handler parameterised by <see cref="PipResizeEdge"/>: a
/// left/top drag moves x/y so the OPPOSITE edge stays anchored. The bands live in a top-Z, hit-test-pass-through layer,
/// so only the bands themselves take input and everything inside (MediaPlayerElement's transport included) is untouched.

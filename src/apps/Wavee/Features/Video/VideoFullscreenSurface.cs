/// The FULLSCREEN VIDEO surface — the full-bleed home for <see cref="SurfacePlacement.Fullscreen"/>, and a REAL
/// fullscreen: entering drives the OS window borderless-fullscreen on the monitor it sits on
/// (<c>InputHooks.WindowSetFullscreen</c> → <c>IWindow.SetFullscreen</c>), and the shell UNMOUNTS the title bar and the
/// global player bar for the duration (<c>WaveeShell</c>, gated on <see cref="PlaybackBridge.VideoFullscreenActive"/>).
/// Nothing here is merely hidden: extra layers stacked above a full-screen video defeat the composition fast path and
/// cost real GPU, so they leave the tree entirely.
///
/// <para><b>ONE transport.</b> The video's own auto-hiding transport is the only transport while this surface is up —
/// <see cref="PlaybackBridge.TransportOwnerNow"/> resolves to <see cref="TransportOwner.Fullscreen"/>, the player bar
/// unmounts, and no surface renders a second bar. This surface therefore RESERVES NOTHING: it used to carry two
/// pass-through bands (a <c>TitleBar.ExpandedHeight</c> strip at top and a <c>WaveeSize.PlayerBarH</c> strip at bottom,
/// inherited from <see cref="ImmersiveLyricsSurface"/>, whose own chrome legitimately stays reachable) and those bands
/// are exactly what stacked the global 72-DIP bar under the video's own. Full-bleed, no bands.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Prior OS state is REMEMBERED, never assumed.</b> Exit restores whatever <c>IsWindowFullscreen</c> reported
/// at enter — it does NOT call <c>WindowSetFullscreen(false)</c> unconditionally (which is what
/// <c>MediaPlayerElement</c>'s own overlay path does, clobbering a window the user had already put in OS fullscreen).</para>
///
/// <para>Content is the SHARED <see cref="PopOutVideoStage"/> (<c>PopOutVideoWindow.cs</c>) — the same stage
/// <see cref="InWindowVideoPip"/> and <c>PopOutVideoWindow</c> present, bound to <see cref="PlaybackBridge.VideoPlayer"/>
/// and keyed on the binding generation. This surface NEVER builds a <c>MediaPlayer</c>: the engine player is owned by
/// <c>FluentVideoMediaHost</c>, and every placement only BINDS a <see cref="FluentGpu.Controls.Media.MediaPlayerElement"/>
/// to it — which is what lets a placement move re-bind a presenter instead of restarting playback from 0.</para>
///
/// <para><b>NO OPACITY CHANNEL ON ANY ANCESTOR OF THE HOLE.</b> <c>DrawOp.DrawVideo</c> is a DestOut erase against the
/// back buffer; a fade on an ancestor multiplies cumulative opacity into it (a washed-out, translucent video with the

/// where the erase never reaches the real back buffer and the video vanishes entirely (the docked-video plan's §2
/// ancestor table). So <see cref="EnterTerminal"/>/<see cref="ExitTerminal"/> below carry a SCALE only — no
/// <c>Opacity</c> component — unlike <see cref="ImmersiveLyricsSurface"/>'s own terminals, which fade freely because
/// that stage has no video hole to protect. The scale terminal still carries the ⚠️ the same table names (the hole
/// scales about the node centre, the DirectComposition child does not, so there is a brief visual misalignment for the

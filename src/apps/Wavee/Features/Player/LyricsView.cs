    // is not one spring on the viewport — it is N springs on the LINES.

    // the first-landing branch already proves out: one offset write + one content transform + one restore latch + one
    // Mark, and never a RequestRerender) and the felt motion is a per-line COMPENSATING translate springing back to 0.

    //   decays to 0, which IS the felt travel.

    // ── The interlude: the finished line RETIRES, three dots keep time ───────────────────────────────────────────────
    // When a line is sung out and the next one is a real instrumental break away, the reference does NOT leave the
    // finished line sitting half-lit on the focal band (the old `_interlude` recede — scale 0.97 / opacity 0.55 / σ1 —
    // which read as a still-selected line that had broken). It RETIRES it: the line takes the ORDINARY past treatment
    // (past bit, its rung of the past opacity/σ ladder), focus moves on to the upcoming line, and the silence is marked
    // by three breathing dots just above it. There is therefore no "interlude look" for a lyric row at all any more —
    // the whole feature is (a) an early active-line advance and (b) an overlay. Bit 3 of the packed emphasis, which
    // carried the recede, is now unused.
    //
    // WHY THE ADVANCE ALONE DOES THE JOB. AdvancePastInterlude runs on the RESOLVED line (N), never on its own output,
    // so it is a pure function of the clock: it answers N+1 on every frame of the break and stops answering the moment
    // ResolveLine itself reaches N+1 (at nextStart − LeadMs). No sticky state, no release edge — and the value it
    // produces at that boundary is exactly the value the plain lead-shifted resolve produces, so the advance ends
    // without a second handoff. Because it lands in `active` BEFORE `activeChanged` is computed, the ONSET is a normal
    // handoff: PushEmphasis retires line N onto the past ladder, ScrollActiveIntoView latches the viewport and
    // ArmCascade flies the document, so line N+1 sits at the focal band in its unsung-gray-sharp state (dist 0, wipe
    // split 0 — nothing special needed, that is simply what a line that has not started looks like) for the whole
    // break. When the break ends, nothing moves at all: the line just starts filling.
    //
    // WHY THE DOTS ARE AN OVERLAY AND NOT A ROW. A pseudo-row would have to exist in the measured layout, which means
    // the virtual window, the ExtentTable, the per-line emphasis/σ/glow/cascade arrays and every `index → line` mapping
    // in this file would grow a conditional off-by-one for the duration of a gap — a large blast radius bought for
    // something that carries no reading-order meaning and is never scrolled to. Instead the dots are a sibling of the
    // scroll viewport in the ZStack, anchored at the SAME band fraction the follow targets. The scroll, virtualization
    // and cascade machinery is untouched; the only thing the two paths share is `FocalBand`.
    //
    // A11Y. The engine's element surface exposes a semantic Role but no automation NAME (names come from text
    // content), and the dots have no text to name them with. So rather than mint a role that would announce nothing,
    // the row is `HitTestVisible = false` — excluded from hit-testing and focus for its whole subtree, i.e. explicitly
    // decorative. Nothing is lost: the information it carries (a break is elapsing) is already implied by the lyric
    // rows themselves, which remain the focusable, seekable, readable surface throughout.

    // The gap that must open between a line's sung-out point and the next line's start before the break counts as an
    // interlude at all. ONE constant — it replaced the inline `gap >= 4000` recede test. Below it the handoff stays the

    //   • ArmCascade            — every stagger delay drops to 0, so every line shares the one rate: the document makes
    //                             ONE rigid, gently-settling translate instead of a top-first waterfall.
    //   • LyricLineView.WipeLiftFor — Lift = 0 on BOTH wipe layers (main + glow): no per-word rise.
    //   • LyricLineView.Render  — scale flat 1.0 (no 0.98 breathing), folded into the emphasis spring's DepKey so the
    //                             first re-render after a settings flip retargets instead of holding the old scale.
    //   • DriveInterludeDots    — the dots hold still (pulse pinned to its peak) but keep FILLING across the gap.
    // What deliberately STAYS: the karaoke wipe, the opacity ladder, the DoF blur ladder and the interlude dots' fill.
    // Those are INFORMATION — they say which words have been sung, which line is live and how much of the instrumental
    // break is left — not decoration, and dropping them would break the view.
    // (Wave F hook: the immersive surface's drifting cover backdrop must read this too and hold still.)

    // ── the hover/press SCOPE (the container trap, and why the menu is not attached to the column) ────────────────────
    //
    // THE DEFECT. Attaching the context menu straight to the column box made the whole cluster ONE hover family:
    // hovering the gap between two transport buttons lit the heart, and pressing anywhere lit EVERY button's plate at
    // once. Nothing in this file was wrong on its own — the mechanism is the engine's, and it is worth writing down:
    //   1. `OnContextRequested` sets InteractionInfo.ContextBit, and ContextBit is in InputDispatcher's `hitAnywhere`
    //      mask — an element with a context flyout is a hit-test target in its own right (the WinUI rule). So a pointer
    //      over the column's own BACKGROUND (a gap between controls; the row padding) resolved the COLUMN as the hit.
    //   2. `AnimScheduler.SetHover` then runs SetHoverDescendants from that node: a descendant that carries a
    //      reveal/scale affordance follows its CONTAINER's hover — and every StageChrome button carries HoverScale.
    //   3. `SetPress` used to be worse: SetPressDescendants recursed UNCONDITIONALLY, with no interactive boundary at
    //      all, so one press on the container drove PressTarget on every descendant with an interact row.
    //
    // (3) IS NOW FIXED IN THE ENGINE. SetPressDescendants carries the same nested-interactive boundary hover has: a
    // container press drives a boundary child (a button that owns an interact row still lights) and STOPS beneath it,
    // and the interact-row gate is the reach filter for everything else. `AnimSuite` gate 58c pins it. What that does
    // NOT fix is (1): the container is still the HIT, so it still owns the press/hover for every gap between controls,
    // and its own non-boundary reveal descendants still follow it. The shield below is therefore still load-bearing —
    // it is the answer to hit OWNERSHIP and to the hover cascade, not just to the press one.
    //
    // THE FIX, without losing right-click-anywhere. The menu goes on a SHELL (a ZStack) plus a childless full-bleed
    // SHIELD layer beneath the content:
    //   • the SHIELD always wins the hit over the shell's own box (InputDispatcher.Hit self-hits only when no child
    //     matched), and it has NO CHILDREN — so the hover/press cascade from it reaches exactly nothing;
    //   • the shell keeps ContextBit as an ANCESTOR, which is what the "⋯" button's ClickRequestsContext needs (the
    //     context funnel walks self-or-ancestors) and what carries a right-click on the art / title / a button up to the
    //     menu. An ancestor is safe: HoverWithin is published only for Pointer/Click/Pressed bits, never ContextBit, and
    //     the press target is the deepest HIT node, which the shield now is.
    //
    // THE CONTRACT, for anything added here later: NO stage container that has several interactive descendants may own a
    // pointer/click/press handler. Handlers live on the leaf controls; a container that must own one contains only its
    // own reveal affordance. The shield is the one exception and it is allowed precisely because it is childless.

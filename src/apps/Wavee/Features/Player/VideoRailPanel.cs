/// The <see cref="RailMode.Video"/> TAKEOVER body (docked-video design §5.3) — everything BELOW the shared pinned
/// card slot: the current track's own title/meta, a rule, and the next few queue entries. The card itself
/// (<see cref="Wavee.Features.Video.DockedVideoSurface"/>) is mounted by <c>RightRail</c> as a SIBLING above this
/// panel, not inside it — this panel starts exactly where the card ends.
///
/// <para><b>The B10 empty state.</b> When the current track has no video, <see cref="DockedVideoSurface"/>'s own
/// mount gate collapses it to nothing (freeing the decode surface — a track with no video has nothing to decode),
/// but <see cref="RailMode.Video"/> itself does NOT close: closing the rail on every non-video track in a mixed
/// playlist would be exactly the "per-track rail thrash" the design calls out. So this panel fills the card's vacated
/// slot with a static "no video for this song" placeholder — the same letterboxed-artwork composition
/// <see cref="DockedVideoSurface"/>'s own poster uses, MINUS the spinner (there is nothing to wait for; the answer is
/// already known). Track meta and Up next keep rendering underneath exactly as they would with video playing — the
/// user is still on this track, they only lose the frame.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Row reuse.</b> <c>QueuePanel</c>'s rows are NOT reused here: they are built around reorder/swipe/context-
/// menu machinery this read-only "next few" list has no use for, and QueuePanel is out of scope for this change
/// besides. <c>NowPlayingPanel</c>'s OWN "Next up" section already solves exactly this problem (a compact, read-only,
/// rail-width row) — but its builder is <c>private</c> to that file, which is also out of scope here. What IS shared
/// and genuinely reusable is the primitive both of them are built from: <see cref="TrackRow.ArtCard"/> with
/// <see cref="TrackRow.ArtCardKind.Rail"/>, the one row cell every surface in the app renders a track through. Reusing
/// the primitive (not a duplicate cell) keeps this panel's rows pixel-identical to the rail's other "next up" list
/// without touching either out-of-scope file.</para>

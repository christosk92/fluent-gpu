// Artist "Top tracks" chart — the ops/scratch/popular-releases-prototype.html row, verbatim geometry:
// rank · 44px art (40px under pressure) · title+subline (E · feat. X +N · plays) · heart · duration,
// Modern: 56px rows + 12px gutters. Classic: 48px rows + S gutters + hairline separators, while retaining artwork.
// ≤2 columns: a third column stole the width the mid column needs for title+feat+plays, and one column
// below ColBreakW of CHART COLUMN for the same reason (paging is the better trade there).
// Behavior stays canonical: the # cell is TrackRow.NumberCell
// (number↔play/pause hover transport + live equalizer), row click = TrackRow.Invoke (toggles pause on the
// now-playing track), TrackRow.Heart. Hard 5-row height.
//
// The chart is ONE PagedShelf collection — a 5-row virtual strip with page-mandatory snapping — NOT a page-swapped
// slice: a page flip slides the realized window, so a row that stays on screen keeps its identity and its state. That
// is what the keys encode: a realized cell is keyed by its TRACK URI and never by its ordinal (an ordinal in the key is
// what used to remount all five rows on every flip); only the density TIER rides along, because those props freeze at
// mount and a tier flip must be a deliberate remount. PagedShelf owns the page state, the snap interval, the glide and
// the pips — this file must not re-add a page signal, a pages clamp, or a scroll animation of its own.
//
// Row chrome is the prototype's `.row` verbatim and deliberately has NO zebra: transparent fill over a
// 1px TRANSPARENT border (a present-but-invisible stroke so hover never nudges layout), painting only on
// hover/press. The row body paints NO fill for the now-playing track either — that state is carried by content
// (the NumberCell equalizer + the accent title), never by a wash. This is also what SkeletonDeriver leaves
// standing (it strips Fill/Border/hover brushes), so the
// live chart and its own shimmer read identically. Do not "restore" the bands.
//
// The chart HUGS its rows: Modern is a flat 56px each; Classic is the denser 48px artwork ledger with hairlines. The
// strip simply ends where the last row does. It does
// NOT stretch to meet the (usually taller) Releases column beside it. Both earlier attempts at using that leftover
// height failed the eye — growing the rows made chunky slabs, and distributing it as spacing (SpaceBetween) floated
// small rows in ~137px slots. A ragged band bottom is the correct answer; the rhythm is the shimmer's.

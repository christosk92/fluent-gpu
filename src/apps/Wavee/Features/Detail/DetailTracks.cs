// The right area: a FIXED chrome bar (toolbar + column header) above the track table. WIDTH-ADAPTIVE — as the area
// narrows it DROPS columns by breakpoint (Album → ♥ → art-thumb; #, Title and Duration always stay) so the title
// stays readable and the grid never overflows/overlaps. (The engine also shrink-to-fits an over-wide fixed grid —
// FlexLayout.ResolveColumns — as a backstop.) The active "tier" is derived from the measured width; a breakpoint cross
// REMOUNTS the list (keyed by tier) so every tier mounts one clean, consistent column set: within a tier the row arity
// is stable (recycle-safe), and across a tier the fresh mount sidesteps any recycle-shape churn. Selection survives the
// remount (external SelectionModel); the scroll offset resets on the (rare) breakpoint cross. The now-playing recolour
// re-skins the realized window IN PLACE via the epoch (displacementVersion) so a track change keeps the scroll offset.
// Rows are PLAIN/recyclable (no binds, no Components) → a steady scroll is zero-alloc.

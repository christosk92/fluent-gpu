{
    // ── THE OFFSET MODEL: THE BAND PAINTS NO FILL ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    //
    // The band has NO material. Not a translucent one, not an opaque one — none. Scrolled content is CLIPPED at the
    // band's lower edge instead of sliding under it, so the band's 56 (or 93) DIP are an unpainted OMISSION and what
    // shows there is whatever the page's real ground already is: the shell's live Mica smoke on the artist page, the
    // art-derived PageTone plane plus its blurred backdrop on the track-detail pages.
    //
    // WHY THE FILL HAD TO GO. Every fill this band ever wore was an APPROXIMATION of a surface it could not observe.
    // The last one was the honest version of that mistake — ColorContrast.Flatten(FileArea, MicaRef.*Default), the
    // content layer composited onto a no-wallpaper reference tone — and it still could not follow live Mica, which
    // takes its colour from the user's desktop. On a dark wallpaper the reference tone read as a SOLID BLACK SLAB
    // parked across the page (user report, screenshots). Parameterising the flatten over the detail pages' art tone
    // fixed one of the two consumers and left the artist page exactly as wrong; the offset model fixes both, for
    // free, and can never drift — there is no constant left to drift.
    //
    // THE CLIP IS THE CONTRACT. A band with no fill is only a band if nothing renders into its region:
    //   · artist page      — ONE ClipTopAtViewport bind at ContextBandLayout.Height on the magazine body + the blend
    //                        wash (ArtistPage.Body).
    //   · album / show     — the trailing scroller's ClipTopAtViewport at DetailVerticalLayout.StickyClipInset
    //                        (56 identity row + 36 column row + 1 hairline), already in place (DetailTracks.TrailingBody).
    //   · playlist / liked — the virtual list's ItemClipTopInset at the same inset, already in place
    //                        (DetailTracks.ApplyVerticalItemBand). Its ItemClipTopFadeBand feathers the cut.
    // Both engine mechanisms self-gate: the clip engages only once content actually reaches the line and releases
    // when it leaves, so there is no state to keep in sync with the band's reveal ramp.
    //
    // WHAT STILL PAINTS: the hairline under the band, the pivot's active underline, and the text ink. That is all.

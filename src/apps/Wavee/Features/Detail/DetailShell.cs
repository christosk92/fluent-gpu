        //      ContentHost exclusively owns route-level entrance motion, and a cover fly must not compete with it.
        //   2. Setting it back would change NOTHING, because the forward capture is gone repo-wide. ConnectedAnimation
        //      only fills its pending-snapshot slot from Begin(); CaptureOnLeave is an explicit no-op ("reverse-fly
        //      capture is Phase 6"). SharedTransition.Begin/BeginConfigured have ZERO callers outside AppHost's own

        //      pending snapshot ⇒ Tick65 never seeds a flight. Publishing a key here would only re-register this cover
        //      as a tagged participant and make the pairing LOOK wired while still never flying.
        //   3. The reason from (1) is still live. ContentHost's PageTransition is MotionRecipes.PageSlideForward/Back
        //      (Position|Opacity, Dx = Expressive.DistBase = 8, Enter Opacity 0), and SceneStore.AbsoluteRect INCLUDES
        //      ancestor LocalTransform.Dx — so the dest rect moves every frame of the slide. That drives

        //      up from 0 (DestReady gates on image decode, not on page opacity).

        // Re-enabling therefore means restoring the whole capture seam (a `morph` action back on DetailNav.OpenAlbum /
        // OpenPlaylist, threaded from HomeCardNav and RecentsPage, plus UseContext(SharedTransition.Begin) here) AND

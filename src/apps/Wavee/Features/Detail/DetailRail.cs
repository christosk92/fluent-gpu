    // the eyebrow, the owner block, the artist face pile, the meta line, the daylist strip and the description exist
    // only once the full model is in — so the second render INSERTS rows into the middle of the column.
    //
    // The reconciler matches UNKEYED siblings by POSITION + TYPE (Reconciler.ReconcileChildrenCore). Unkeyed, that
    // insert used to UPDATE the title's TextEl into the newly-first eyebrow run and mount a second TextEl below it for
    // the title: the hero visibly relabelled itself for a frame and every row under it jumped. So every structural row
    // carries a STABLE key — constant across preview→full, and deliberately free of model text (the `save:` /
    // `daylist:` / `prerelease:` keys elsewhere in this file are the opposite case: they encode identity BECAUSE those
    // components must remount when it changes).

    // Keys alone fix the relabel; the two specs below calm the shove that is left. The engine bakes Enter/Exit/Layout
    // for BoxEl ONLY (Reconciler, `case BoxEl`) — on a bare TextEl/ComponentEl they are silently dropped — which is
    // why the non-box rows go through the wrapper helpers rather than carrying the fields themselves.

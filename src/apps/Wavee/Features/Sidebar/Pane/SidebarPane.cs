// R3.0.1 — THE ONE SIDEBAR PANE RENDERER. Extracted from `Modes/CuratedSidebar.cs`; every mode (Classic, Library V3,
// Curated) is now a DOCUMENT + a `SidebarPaneConfig` over this single component, so paddings, badges, rhythm and motion
// cannot triple and drift again (which is exactly what the user's screenshot review found in the three-container build).
//
// THE ONE STRUCTURAL DECISION (§C1.7): the document is not rendered section-by-section. `SidebarRowPlanner` flattens
// (document × projection) into ONE `SidebarRow[]` — headers, dividers, rows, grid strips, cards, prompts, placeholders,
// empty/skeleton rows — and this component renders it through ONE `ItemsView.CreateBound` over a MEASURED variable-extent
// layout. That is what lets a 10k-entry PlaylistTree or EntityList virtualize end-to-end: a `Grow=1` list inside an outer
// ScrollView cannot. There are therefore NO nested scrollers and no `Flow.For` over the projection anywhere in the pane.
//
// HOW A FRAME FLOWS
//   1. This component subscribes the document + projection + pin + folder + search + MODE epochs and re-plans in a UseMemo
//      keyed on their fold (the planner is pure and reuses ONE caller-owned SidebarPlanBuffers per pane — the expanded
//      pane and the rail each own their own instance, because a plan ALIASES its buffers).
//   2. The plan is published to the bound row slots as a PLAIN FIELD (never a signal write from Render — the render-purity
//      rule). Each slot is its own Component (`SidebarPaneSlot`) that reads `Index.Value` (so a recycle re-renders exactly
//      that row) plus the same epochs (so a projection rebuild or a live customizer edit re-renders the realized window
//      without the list rebuilding).
//   3. The row count is the ONE thing the frozen-at-mount ItemsView cannot read from a field: it rides `CountSignal`,
//      written in a layout effect (a render-time signal write would be a backwards write, and the DEBUG ReuseGuard
//      explicitly rejects a changed frozen ItemCount).
//
// LIVE EDITS: every Curated mutation goes through `SidebarPreferences.Dispatch(command)` → reducer → undo pre-image →
// `LayoutVersion` bump → autosave. This pane subscribes `LayoutVersion`, so the customizer never talks to the renderer: it
// dispatches, and both the live pane and its own preview re-plan from the one document.
//
// SELECTION — ONE mechanism for every mode (R3.0.2). Row-local interaction tint and the 3×16 accent indicator both live
// in the item container, exactly like WinUI NavigationViewItem. On a route edge the two realized item indicators receive
// the same outgoing/incoming 600-ms Offset+Scale choreography as NavigationView.cpp; a recycle is a snap, never a replay.
//
// MOTION (Revision 2's token table + R3.1.7): section collapse/expand chevrons rotate on `MotionTok.ControlFast`
// (`SidebarChevron`); the rows a collapse/expand adds or displaces ride the ItemsView's entrance/FLIP seed channel (see
// `Choreograph`); reordering is `MotionTok.ItemPlacement` through `Reorderable`; the design switch is SidebarHost's
// `MotionTok.ControlFast`.

        //     re-entry condition and the pane already subscribes the route through TrackSelection);
        //   • Tok.Epoch — a memo is invisible to RethemeAll, which re-renders components but cannot re-enter a memo

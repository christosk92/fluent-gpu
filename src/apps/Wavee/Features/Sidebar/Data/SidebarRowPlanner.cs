// The Curated sidebar's RENDER CONTRACT: a SidebarCustomLayout plus the live projection, planned into ONE flat row list.
//
// WHY FLAT. The pane is a single scroll surface. A PlaylistTree or EntityList over a 10k library cannot virtualize as a
// Grow=1 child inside an outer ScrollView, so the document is planned into one flat SidebarRow[] (headers, dividers,
// rows, grid strips, cards, prompts, placeholders, empty/skeleton rows) and rendered by ONE ItemsView.CreateBound with
// RepeatLayout.VariableList — which virtualizes the whole pane end-to-end regardless of section count or library size.
//
// WHY APP-SIDE. The spec places the planner in Wavee.Core; it cannot live there, because it consumes SidebarLibraryEntry
// (Features/Sidebar/Data/SidebarLibraryEntry.cs) and Wavee.Core may not reference the app assembly. The planner is still
// PURE — no engine type, no service, no signal, no clock — so Wavee.Tests drives it by source-including this one file.
//
// ALLOCATION. No string is allocated during planning: a row's Key is always an EXISTING string (the entry's Id, the
// item's Key, or the section's Id), never a concatenation. Row/entry storage is a caller-owned SidebarPlanBuffers, so a
// re-plan reuses capacity and a warm re-plan of a 10k library allocates nothing.

/// <summary>The row vocabulary the Curated renderer switches on. Also the ItemsView's <c>ContentType</c>, so each kind
/// gets its own recycling pool.</summary>

// The STABLE pin identity scheme (F.5.4). Engine-free (System only), source-included by src/apps/Wavee.Tests.
//
// The pin id IS the nav route key for every navigable kind. That single choice buys three things at once:
//   * a pinned row renders its label/glyph through ShellNav.Dest(id, name) with no extra plumbing (which is why the
//     "show:" arm in ShellNav is a prerequisite — F.6),
//   * the recency join against HistoryStore is an identity lookup on Route.Name (F.7.6), and
//   * a pin survives a library refresh, because it never depends on a list index.

/// <summary>One pinned sidebar item. <see cref="Id"/> is the STABLE identity (F.5.4) and is also the nav route key for
/// every kind except <see cref="SidebarEntryKind.Folder"/>. <see cref="Name"/>/<see cref="Uri"/> are a display CACHE so a
/// pinned row paints instantly offline before the library resolves; they are refreshed by the projection and are never
/// the source of truth.

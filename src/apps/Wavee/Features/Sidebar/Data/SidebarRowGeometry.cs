// THE ONE ROW-GEOMETRY LADDER, in the engine-free layer so it is unit-testable.
//
// WHY IT MOVED HERE. `SidebarRowMetrics` (Shared/SidebarEntityRow.cs) used to own the height/indent ladder outright, but
// that file is engine-bound (`SidebarCover`, `Icon`, `BoxEl`) and is therefore NOT source-included by Wavee.Tests — so the
// single most load-bearing number in the sidebar ("Cozy+subtitle = 44 = Classic's row") could not be asserted anywhere.
// The arithmetic now lives here (System + Wavee.Core.Sidebar only) and `SidebarRowMetrics` DELEGATES, so there is still
// exactly one ladder and a test can now pin Classic's document and a Curated template to the same number.
//
// It also owns the two PURE geometry primitives the pane needs over a planned row list: the cumulative content-space Y of
// a row (the analytic offset drop placement / bring-into-view uses) and the selection TRAVEL
// DIRECTION between two plan indices, which is what makes the row's selection indicator move *toward* the new selection
// instead of cross-fading in place.

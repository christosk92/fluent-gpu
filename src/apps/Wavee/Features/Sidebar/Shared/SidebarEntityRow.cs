// F.1.4 — THE ONE sidebar entity row. Classic's pinned rows, Library V3's list rows and Curated's entity rows all come
// out of Create(in SidebarRowSpec) so the three designs cannot drift apart visually.
//
// WHAT IT OWNS (and why nothing else may re-implement it):
//
//  • The 4-STATE SELECTION-AWARE HOVER/PRESS RAMP — the stock NavigationViewItem backplate ladder
//    (NavigationView.cs:1174-1176 / NavigationView_themeresources): rest Transparent · Selected=Secondary; hover
//    Secondary · SelectedPointerOver=Tertiary; pressed Tertiary · SelectedPressed=Secondary. A selected row must DARKEN
//    on hover, never flatten into its own rest fill. This is copied verbatim from the landed WaveeSidebar rows; the whole
//    reason this factory exists is that the ramp is written ONCE.
//  • The height ladder by density, the 3-DIP selection gutter (the pill's reserve — see SidebarSelectionPill), the depth
//    indent, and the slot order.
//  • OnRealized CHAINING for the selection pill: a row both registers its node for the pill AND can carry a caller's own
//    realize handler; ContextMenu.Attach chains onto whatever this leaves behind (it never clobbers).
//
// PURE STATIC by design: a Component per row would cost a mount per slot in a virtualized 10k list. Nothing here
// allocates beyond the returned records and the children array.

/// <summary>Row-height + metric rules, split out so a virtualizing surface can size a slot WITHOUT building the row.
///
/// <para>The height / indent ARITHMETIC is not here: it lives in <see cref="SidebarRowGeometry"/> (engine-free, and
/// therefore the only version a test can reach — this file is engine-bound and is deliberately not source-included by

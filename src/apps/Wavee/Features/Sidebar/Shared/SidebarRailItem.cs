//
// Locked decision 7 makes the rail's CONTENT mode-specific (Classic shows pins → shortcuts → playlist covers; V3 shows
// its filter/entity strip; Curated shows the sections that opted into the rail). The TILE is shared, so all three rails
// have the same hit box, the same 6/8-DIP corner ladder, the same selected treatment and the same tooltip behaviour.
//
// Every visual below is copied verbatim from the landed WaveeSidebar CompactIcon / CompactArt / CompactDivider /
// CompactSkeleton so relocating those call sites is a pure refactor.

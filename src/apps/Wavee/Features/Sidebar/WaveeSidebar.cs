// MODE A / "CLASSIC" of the three-mode sidebar (spec §3.1). Mounted only by SidebarHost, under the "sidebar.classic" key.
//
// R3.0.2 — WHAT THIS FILE USED TO BE, AND WHY IT ISN'T ANY MORE. Classic shipped as a hand-built pane: its own expanded
// body, its own pinned section + reorder wiring + drop zone, its own 56-DIP rail, its own row builders, its own count
// badge, its own per-kind subtitle table, its own selection mechanism. Curated and V3 shipped their own of each. Three
// containers sharing only leaf primitives is why the user's screenshot review found four left insets, accent count pills
// in one mode and quiet numbers in another, no section rhythm and no collapse motion: nothing could be fixed in one place.
//
// Classic is now a LOCKED BUILT-IN DOCUMENT (`SidebarBuiltInDocuments.Classic`) rendered by the ONE `SidebarPane`. This
// component is the mode shell: it supplies the document, routes a header click to Classic's own persisted section flags,
// declares itself READ-ONLY (no customizer entry — the quick menu's "Customize" still switches to Curated first, which is
// landed behaviour), and hands the rail its create-playlist affordance. Everything visual comes from the shared renderer.
//
// THE PRESERVATION CONTRACT (§3.1.1) IS HONOURED AT THE PIXEL LEVEL, NOT THE IMPLEMENTATION LEVEL — the user's explicit
// choice in R3.0. What survives verbatim: the pane padding (8,8,8,12) and therefore the 8+6=14 row inset; the 44-DIP row
// height for every band (see the document's Display options); the 12/600/TextSecondary header typography; the leading
// `rule:` dividers; the 4-state NavigationViewItem backplate ramp; 32-DIP playlist covers with the song-count subtitle;
// the async count badges (now quiet numbers — the ONE badge the user asked for); the always-mounted expanded + rail layers
// measured at the persisted open width; the DevTools entry; the pinned drop zone; the quick layout menu on the first
// header and on the pane's background context menu. The DEVIATIONS are listed in the handoff, not hidden: selection is the
// per-row indicator (a recycling list cannot host a measured overlay pill), the pinned list is virtualized and therefore
// uncapped (no "Show all (n)" row), and pinned reorder uses the displacement channel rather than a live projection.
//
// MOTION: pane width is still the shell wrapper's (WaveeShell.cs SizeMode.Reflow); section chevrons rotate on
// MotionTok.ControlFast; a collapse/expand fades + glides the rows it adds or displaces (SidebarPane.Choreograph);
// reordering is MotionTok.ItemPlacement.

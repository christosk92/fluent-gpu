// §C6 + F.4.3 — the PURE decisions behind the selection UX: when the one-time chooser may open, what marks it seen,
// which design the chooser starts on, when the "Customize sidebar" affordance is live, and the int↔enum coercion the
// three preview cards select through.
//
// ENGINE-FREE BY CONSTRUCTION (System + IAppSettings + SidebarDesign + the generated Strings consts). That is
// load-bearing: this file is source-included by src/apps/Wavee.Tests (which has no FluentGpu.Engine reference) so
// SidebarDesignGatingTests drives the REAL marker state machine instead of a copy of it — exactly like SidebarDesign.cs
// and SidebarPinStore.cs. Nothing here may reference Signal<T>, Element, Loc or any other engine type: the picker's
// visuals live in SidebarDesignPicker.cs, and the chooser's scheduling in SidebarOnboardingChrome.cs.
//
// WHY A SEPARATE FILE AT ALL. The gate is one boolean read and the marker one boolean write, but getting either wrong is
// unrecoverable per install: a marker burned too early permanently denies the chooser to the fresh installs it exists
// for, and a marker never written shows a "one-time" dialog on every launch. Both are exactly the kind of thing a unit
// test pins and a code review does not.

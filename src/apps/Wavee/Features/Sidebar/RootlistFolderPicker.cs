// "MOVE TO FOLDER…" — the third non-mouse route into the rootlist (D12), beside Move up / Move down and the Alt+arrows.
//
// WHY A PICKER AT ALL. Move up/down walk one sibling at a time and "Move out of {parent}" climbs exactly one level, so
// filing a playlist into a folder that is not adjacent to it was a DRAG and nothing else — across a scrolling 240-DIP
// pane, possibly into a folder that is currently collapsed. The picker names every legal destination at once and needs
// no pointer travel at all.
//
// WHAT IT REUSES. The flyout shell, the search field and the row rhythm are `PlaylistPickerPanel`'s; the legality rule
// is `RootlistTreeNav`/`RootlistTreeMoves` (the same table the drop cue draws its refusals from, so the picker cannot
// offer a destination a drag would refuse); and the commit is `FolderActions.Commit` — i.e. `WaveeResourceDrop.
// MoveRootlist`, the very call a DROP makes, with its awaited failure mapping, its announce, its "Moved to {name}"
// toast and its Undo.
//
// HOSTED IN A CONTENT DIALOG, not an anchored flyout: this opens from a CONTEXT MENU, and the menu that launched it is
// gone by invoke time, so there is no anchor node left to place against. Exactly the reason `Menus.OpenPicker` hosts
// the playlist picker the same way.

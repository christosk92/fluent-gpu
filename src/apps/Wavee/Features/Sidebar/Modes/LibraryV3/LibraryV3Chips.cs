/// <summary>
/// §3.2.4 — the library filter rail: Playlists · Podcasts · Albums · Artists, where the SELECTED facet carries its own
/// sub-filter (the playlist qualifier: By you · By Spotify · Mixed) instead of a second rail beneath it.
///
/// <para>ONE ROW, THE MORPHING FACET GRAMMAR. This surface used to stack a primary chip rail over a conditional qualifier
/// rail — two bands, 68 DIP of chrome, and a qualifier that read as a peer of the kinds rather than as a property of
/// Playlists. It now speaks the app's existing facet-chip language, copied from <c>HomeFacetChips</c> (which in turn is
/// the Concerts filter-bar grammar in <c>ConcertUi.FilterToken</c>/<c>ConcertUi.SegmentedPill</c>):</para>
/// <list type="number">
/// <item>picking a facet CHECKS its pill (accent fill + check mark) and, if that facet owns a sub-filter, SPILLS the
///   sub-options inline right after it — inside the facet's own tight group, so they read as its children;</item>
/// <item>picking one of those options FUSES it into the pill: the pill becomes a compound accent capsule
///   <c>[✓ Playlists │ By you ▾]</c> — a raised inner segment carrying the facet, then the value, then a chevron;</item>
/// <item>tapping the fused pill drops the sub-filter and re-spills the options (one step back, not all the way);
///   tapping the plain checked pill clears the facet back to All. Both directions are the same reverse morph.</item>
/// </list>
///
/// <para>THE FUSION MECHANISM IS A SHARED KEY, and it is the only reason this morphs instead of popping: the loose pill and
/// the fused pill are emitted under the SAME key (<c>"v3f{code}"</c>) inside the SAME always-present group node, so the
/// reconciler REUSES that node across the swap and the width-reflow recipe both shapes carry has a previous width to
/// animate from. Distinct keys (or a group that only exists while options are spilled) unmount one pill and mount
/// another, and there is nothing left to reflow. The motion recipes below are <c>ConcertUi</c>'s verbatim — 220 ms
/// width reflow on the loose pill, 260 ms on the fused one, the 300 ms segment dock, the 220 ms
/// <c>FluentAccelerate</c> option fly — so the sidebar and the homepage feel like one control. Only the SCALE is the
/// sidebar's (28-DIP pills, 13/12 pt text, the pane's <c>FillSubtle*</c> ramp): a 240–320 DIP rail cannot carry the
/// page's 32-DIP bordered tokens.</para>
///
/// <para>Two decisions worth not re-litigating. (1) The four kind pills are ALWAYS shown: they are the app's own fixed
/// taxonomy, and hiding one because the library has not warmed yet makes the filter set look unstable — a kind with zero
/// entries still filters, and the honest result is the "empty by filter" state. (2) The qualifier is the opposite: it
/// exists only when the data actually distinguishes ≥2 known provenance classes (<c>Entries.QualifiersAvailable</c>,
/// which is <c>SidebarProjection.QualifiersAvailable</c>'s ≥2-flavor rule), so an unevidenced qualifier is not offered
/// and the checked Playlists pill simply never fuses. A persisted qualifier whose precondition stops holding is CLEARED
/// here — a filter you cannot see must never keep filtering.</para>
///
/// <para>The rail is ONE tab stop with roving focus (the <c>RadioButtons</c> pattern) over whatever is currently on it —
/// the four pills, plus the spilled options while they are up. Left/Right move the index and re-place the focus visual,
/// Home/End jump, Space/Enter activate, Tab leaves. Seven chips must not cost seven of the pane's nine tab stops
/// (§3.2.12). There is no leading clear-X: the checked pill IS the toggle (as on the homepage), and the one-gesture
/// "Clear filters" lives in the toolbar overflow (<c>LibraryV3Session.ClearAllFilters</c>).</para>

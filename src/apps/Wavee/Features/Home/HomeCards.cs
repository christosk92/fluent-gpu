// ── The Home card vocabulary ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// One skin per CONTENT SHAPE, rather than one square card reused for twelve kinds of thing. Every number here is quoted
// from the design prototype (wavee-home-fluent.html) — its CSS is the spec, and the class name each skin implements is
// named in its doc comment so the two can be diffed.
//
// Authored on engine primitives (BoxEl / Ui.* / Tok.*) plus the app's own plumbing (Surfaces.Artwork for the
// decode+mosaic+placeholder pipeline, Interaction recipes for the state ramps) — deliberately NOT wrappers over
// MediaCard, whose shelf/grid cards are the look this replaces.
//
// Two conventions that are load-bearing:
//   • THE SPINE. A 2px hairline of the item's own colour along the card's bottom edge, and the ONLY place a per-item
//     colour touches a card. It belongs to exactly seven skins (quick tile, weekly, mix segment, chip card, feature,
//     crowd row, feed card) and to none of the tabular rows — see Spine().
//   • NO TABULAR FIGURES. The text seam has no font-variant-numeric, so every numeric column reserves a fixed-width
//     cell instead of relying on font features to align digits.
//
// EVERY skin must survive a null Meta: FakeData.HomeSeed renders this whole tree with blank cards to DERIVE the loading
// shimmer, so a dereference here is a crash on the loading path, not a display bug.

// ── Live session bootstrap — bring up Connect + playback and swap it into the running app ─────────────────────────────
// Logs in, opens the dealer + the persistent AP channel, builds the full LiveConnect stack, and calls svc.GoLive so the
// UI's PlaybackBridge (bound to the switchable facades) starts reflecting + controlling live playback — with NO UI rebuild.
// Returns null if login/dealer aren't available (the app keeps the in-memory fake backend).
//
// EVERY live install goes through `wiring` (Backend/Wiring/LiveWiring.cs) so it carries its own undo, and the whole
// go-live composition runs inside a rollback: see StartAsync's remarks + GoLiveAttempt at the bottom of this file. A
// bootstrap that throws part-way replays its ledger, disposes what it built, and drops only the handles it owns — a
// racing sibling that already won keeps its own.

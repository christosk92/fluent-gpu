// ── The single library-sync writer loop (§0 tenet 1, §2.2) ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// One serialized consumer owns every network-sourced library-state write (rootlist, memberships, collection sets, revision
// bumps) + the mutation-outbox drain. The DealerRouter/Seam/on-open path/boot only ENQUEUE typed commands; nothing else
// races a store write for the same entity. Optimistic user writes stay inline (UI-frame latency) — their replay/reconcile
// runs here via DrainWrites. Placement in Backend/ keeps it unit-testable against StubTransport.PushEvent + crafted protos.
//
// Phase-1/2/3 scope (docs/library-sync-implementation-plan.md §12): PlaylistRevalidate = full FetchPlaylistAsync (the /diff
// upgrade is Phase 5 — one call-site swap); CollectionPush carries the WIRE set + raw payload — a parseable PubSubUpdate is
// direct-applied on the loop (echo-dropped via the ring, else the items folded through the pending shield, zero round-trip),
// and only an unparseable/empty/zero-item payload falls back to the 250ms-settled delta fetch (wire → logical fan-out).
// ReconnectResync (§6.2): the ordered convergence pass on a drop→Online transition — drain first (local intent wins),
// then rootlist, then token-gated per-set deltas, then /diff for the open + dirty RESIDENT playlists only (anti-herd
// preserved: cold-dirty playlists stay lazy). Rate-limited to one pass per 30s so a flapping network can't storm.

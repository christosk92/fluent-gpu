// ── Connect publishability: what a remote controller is allowed to see ───────────────────────────────────────────────
// A Spotify Connect controller (phone, web player, another desktop) resolves every uri we publish against Spotify's own
// catalog. A `wavee:local:file:…` uri would resolve to NOTHING there — the row renders blank, and a tap on it asks us to
// play a uri it echoed back to us. Spotify solved this for ITS local files long ago with a self-describing namespace:
//
//     spotify:local:<artist>:<album>:<title>:<durationSeconds>
//
// — a uri that carries its own display metadata, so a controller renders the row correctly without resolving anything.
// (Wavee already recognizes that shape inbound; see NotificationPanel's uri-kind test.) So: publishable uris go on the
// wire verbatim, and everything else is rewritten into that shape. The QueueEntry UID is untouched by construction —
// the publisher masks the uri field ONLY — so skip_to/remove commands from a controller still address the right row.

/// <summary>Builds the <c>PublishUriMask</c> hook the <see cref="DeviceStatePublisher"/> applies to the current, prev
/// and next wire rows. Engine-free and pure so the golden wire shapes are unit-testable.</summary>

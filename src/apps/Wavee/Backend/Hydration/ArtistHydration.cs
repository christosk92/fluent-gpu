// ── The artist ladder (design §2.3) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Three transports used to hydrate one artist behind three unrelated entry points: ArtistDiscography.EnsureAsync +
// DiscographyPrefetcher (V4 stubs → cards), SpotifyArtistStatsService (queryArtistOverview, 12h TTL), and
// SpotifyArtistPopularTracksService (spclient chart → TrackV4 → merge → kind-185 counts). Each had its OWN freshness
// gate, its own coalescer and its own "is it cold?" predicate, and they disagreed: the prefetch could leave an artist
// looking hydrated while its chart was still the 10-row seed, and the stats write rewrote TopTracks back to that seed
// under the chart service's feet.
//
// One ladder makes the ORDER explicit, which is what the three-service split kept getting wrong:
//   Open  — the discography is assembled (own stubs upgraded to resident AlbumV4 cards).
//   Rich  — + the overview: stats, the releases column, and the ~10-track seed WITH its play counts.
//   Full  — + the EXTENDED chart (~50) folded onto that seed, then the counts the extension rows lack.
// Because Full runs Rich first, "stats rewrote TopTracks to the seed" is no longer a race — it is a step.

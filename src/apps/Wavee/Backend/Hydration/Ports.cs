// ── The transport seams the engine talks to (design §2.2) ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The engine (router, ledger, pump, per-kind ladders) lives in Backend and must stay engine-free and provider-neutral in
// SHAPE; the Spotify transports (extended-metadata, Pathfinder, spclient REST, the LibrarySync writer loop) implement
// these ports from SpotifyLive/Hydration. Every port returns MAPPED domain objects or "what landed" — no GraphQL/proto
// type crosses (architecture.md §4.4). A second provider adds its own implementations; nothing here changes.

/// <summary>The catalogue arm: extended-metadata V4/205 for a mixed-kind uri batch, conditional (etag) and chunked
/// (<see cref="Wavee.Backend.Metadata.MetadataChunking"/> — 300 entities / body bytes) — ONE POST per chunk regardless
/// of how many kinds ride it. <paramref name="extraKinds"/> are (uri, ExtensionKind) pairs a ladder wants FUSED under
/// the same uri group in the same POST (album Rich adds kind 183). Returns the uris whose PROJECTION wrote an entity —
/// never merely "requested" — so the ledger seals on outcome (the contract the deleted IMetadataSource seam had).</summary>

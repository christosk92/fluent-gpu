// ── which navigations are a `recent_surfaces` PIN REASON (Addendum A5) ────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Opening a detail surface is one of the §A.3 pin reasons: the newest 50 opened surfaces are exempt from the cache-tier
// TTL/budget, so a restart repaints them offline. This is the one place that decides which route names qualify.
//
// It is a NARROWER question than the shell's page routing, which is why it is its own function rather than a reuse of
// `DetailPage.ParseDetail` / `ArtistPage.UriOf` / `ContentHost.IsDetail` (those decide WHICH PAGE renders and must map
// every route, including the two that pin nothing):
//   • `liked` is a SET, not an entity — it is pinned by `collection_items` itself and has no entity row to keep;
//   • `local` resolves to the synthetic uri `wavee:local:all`, which no cold row and no pin table ever contains.
// Recording either would burn one of the 50 LRU slots on a row that can never be read back. Everything else the detail
// surfaces render (`album:` / `pl:` / `show:` / `artist:`) is a real entity uri and is recorded.
//
// Lives in Backend (not Features) because it is pure route→entity mapping with no UI dependency — which is also what
// makes it unit-testable without the shell.

// ── The go-live seam roster (hydration-facade-design.md §2.6) ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The names every live install registers under, as CONSTANTS rather than string literals at the call sites: a typo in
// LiveSessionHost is then a compile error, not a seam that silently misses `AssertCovers`. `All` is what
// `Services.LiveSeams` exposes and what `LiveWiring.AssertCovers` is run against at the end of go-live.
//
// It lives under Backend/ (not beside Services) for ONE reason: Backend\** is source-included by Wavee.Tests, so the
// roster is unit-testable (no duplicates, no blanks) while Services.cs — which drags the whole engine in — is not.
//
// Adding a live install? Add its const here, register it through LiveWiring.Set/Swap at the install site, and add it to
// `All`. Skipping the last step means AssertCovers cannot notice the seam went missing; skipping the middle one means
// AssertCovers throws at go-live. Both are the intended pressure.

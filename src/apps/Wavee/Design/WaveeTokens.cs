// Wavee's geometry token layer. COLOR comes entirely from the engine's WinUI-faithful `Tok.*` (Dsl/Tokens.cs) and the
// spacing / rounding scales come from the engine's `Spacing.*` / `Radii.*` supersets — we do NOT duplicate either. This
// keeps only the fixed sizing scale Tok doesn't carry. The 4px grid is the native tell; every value here is a multiple of 4.

/// <summary>THE ACCENT BUDGET — the three roles accent colour is allowed to play, and the rule that keeps them apart.
///
/// <para>Wavee is deliberately NOT a monochrome Fluent app: the artwork-derived accent is identity, and it stays. What
/// it stopped being is ambient. An accent that appears in four unrelated jobs on one page stops meaning any of them —
/// the reader can no longer tell "click this" from "you are here" from "this is a section". So every accent paint site
/// declares which of exactly THREE roles it is:</para>
///
/// <list type="number">
/// <item><b>AccentAction</b> — "clicking this does the page's primary thing." A SOLID accent plate behind on-accent ink:
/// <see cref="WaveeCta"/>, <c>Button.Accent</c>, the play FABs. AT MOST ONE per screenful of content — if a surface has
/// two, one of them is a secondary and takes <c>Button.Standard</c>. This is the scarcest role and the reason the empty
/// state's action is quiet: an empty page's "Browse" must not outrank the page's real primary.</item>
/// <item><b>AccentSelection</b> — "you are here." The SelectorBar pill, the nav rail's selection bar, a selected chip.
/// Geometry is the tell and it is reserved: a short accent BAR/PILL against the edge of a control means selection and
/// means nothing else. A decorative ornament may not borrow that shape (see the hard rule below).</item>
/// <item><b>AccentDecor</b> — "this content has a colour." Section spines, hero washes, the date captions on concert
/// cards, artist-shelf eyebrows, the module accent facts. Accent as TEXT or as a wash, never as a plate behind ink and
/// never as a selection-shaped bar. This is the largest role by site count and it is kept: it is the identity.</item>
/// </list>
///
/// <para>THE TWO HARD RULES, both enforced by construction after the voice-unification wave:</para>
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item>A decorative ornament may not take SELECTION geometry. The artist section header's old 3×22 r1.5 accent
/// capsule was pixel-for-pixel the selection-indicator shape doing a decorative job; it is now a 20×2 underline sitting
/// under the header text, which is unmistakably a rule and not a selection pill.</item>
/// <item>Accent is never STRUCTURE. A border, a divider, a chevron or a disclosure glyph is chrome; it takes
/// <c>Tok.StrokeDividerDefault</c> / <c>Tok.TextSecondary</c>. Accent on structure was the single largest source of
/// ambient accent in the app (dashed accent borders and accent chevrons on the concert surfaces).</item>

    // The detail pages' ONE art-derived surface: an opaque plane the whole page sits on, replacing the stack of
    // top-anchored alpha washes that used to tint it. Two rules, and they are the whole contract:
    //
    //   1. COMPLEMENTARY, NOT SAMPLED. The tone takes the cover's HUE and nothing else. It is not the cover's dominant
    //      colour re-painted at page scale — that is what produced pages the artwork could not be told apart from.
    //      Saturation and lightness are the page's, not the record's, so two albums by the same artist read as the
    //      same PAGE in two different colours rather than as two different apps.
    //   2. THE CLAMP IS THE POINT. Apple Music's unclamped version of this is its single loudest complaint: a
    //      saturated cover produces a page that is genuinely hard to read, and a dark cover produces one that is
    //      indistinguishable from every other dark cover's. So lightness is FORCED (never sampled) to
    //      <see cref="PageToneDarkL"/> / <see cref="PageToneLightL"/> and saturation is CAPPED at
    //      <see cref="PageToneDarkSMax"/> / <see cref="PageToneLightSMax"/>. The forced lightness is also what makes
    //      the standard Tok ink tokens correct on this plane in both themes — there is no on-media ladder on these
    //      pages, because polarity is guaranteed by construction rather than measured per cover.
    //
    // A cover with no hue worth using (greyscale art, a mosaic of monochrome tiles) gets the NEUTRAL tone instead of
    // an invented tint — the same decision <see cref="ChromeAccent"/> makes for the Play button, for the same reason.

// Semantic type aliases so call sites read INTENT, not raw sizes. Every alias maps to the engine's WinUI type ramp
// (Ui.Caption/Body/BodyStrong/Subtitle/Title/Display in Dsl/Typography.cs). Never author a raw `TextEl { Size = … }`.
//
// THE THREE-PART CONTRACT. Every alias below resolves a SIZE, a LINE HEIGHT and a WEIGHT — never a size alone. That is
// the whole reason to go through an alias rather than `with { Size = 13f }`: a bare size override keeps whatever line
// height the previous rung published, and a page of hand-picked sizes therefore has no vertical rhythm at all. The
// engine ramp carries the pair (12/16 · 14/20 · 14/20-600 · 18/24 · 20/28-600 · 28/36-600 · 40/52-600 · 68/92-600), so
// repointing a call site at an alias brings the line height with it.
//
// WEIGHT POLICY: 400 and 600 only, with two documented divergences. The three DISPLAY-FACE identity aliases
// (ArtistDisplay / ArtistTitle / ArtistCompactTitle) keep their documented 700 — the masthead voice, not UI labels.
// PivotLabel and NpvLyric keep SemiLight 350 — the same WinUI SemiLight the engine's own Pivot control
// (FluentGpu.Controls/Pivot.cs) already uses for its header row; a pivot / Zune lyric reel is a control cut, not a
// body-text weight, so it is not bound by the policy.

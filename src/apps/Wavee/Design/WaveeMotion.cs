// Wavee's ONE motion vocabulary. Hover/press motion everywhere is Wavee's identity — a media app should feel alive
// under the pointer where WinUI is deliberately still — but it is a SYSTEM, not 20 hand-picked numbers. This file owns
// both halves of that system:
//
//   · the three interaction SCALE tiers (below) — every HoverScale/PressScale in the app resolves to one of them;
//   · the Fluent duration ladder — every HoverDurationMs/PressDurationMs/BrushTransitionMs snaps to one of its rungs.
//
// The actual animation is still the engine's: MotionRecipes.*/MotionHooks.* for entrances, MotionTok.* for the
// declarative Transition/While* surface, and the engine's own HoverFade/PressFade slab channels for the scale cues.
//
// ── WHY THE TIERS READ Motion.ReducedMotion AND THE ENGINE DOES NOT ─────────────────────────────────────────────
// Investigated before building this (AnimScheduler.Hover.cs → SeedInteractFade → AnimScheduler.SeedEased): the
// hover/press scale path is the ONLY animated channel in the engine that carries no ReducedMotionPolicy. Structural
// motion goes through SeedMotion/KeyframesMotion, which consult ReducedSnap() and place the channel at its end value;
// the declarative While*/Transition surface carries a MotionTokenDef whose .Reduced policy is honoured the same way.
// But InteractionAnim.HoverT/PressT are seeded by SeedEased(), which has no policy parameter, and SceneRecorder.cs
// (~:772) composites `1 + (HoverScale-1)*HoverT` unconditionally. So a reduced-motion user WOULD still get every
// scale cue, fully eased. The engine is read-only for this wave, and the values are authored app-side anyway, so the
// correct minimal fix is app-side and lives HERE: the tier accessors return 1f under reduced motion, which makes the
// recorder's `MathF.Abs(isc - 1f) > 0.0008f` test fail and skips the transform entirely. This is reduced-motion-
// as-a-VALUE (the canon rule) — a value read during Render, never a hook-order-breaking branch.
// NOT double-suppression: nothing else nulls these. If the engine ever grows a policy on the interaction channels,
// delete the `Motion.ReducedMotion ?` reads here and keep the tiers.

/// as a one-tap lens over the list.
///
/// Spotify's curated set from <c>content-filter/v1/liked-songs</c> is the primary source; chips DERIVED from the tracks
/// in view (extension kind 6 already carries each descriptor's presentation name in the row bundle this list fetches
/// anyway) are the fallback for offline / a 404 account / a shape change.
///
/// A chip can never filter the list to nothing, but that is enforced by AVAILABILITY, not by membership: the curated
/// set is library-scoped and routinely names concepts whose rows have not been enriched yet, so dropping those hid the
/// whole bar on a cold list. They are shown and disabled instead, and become live as enrichment lands.
///
/// Selection is EXCLUSIVE (All + at most one chip). These are a lens, not accumulating constraints — two genres ANDed
/// together almost always yields nothing, and users read a second tap as "switch", not "narrow".</summary>

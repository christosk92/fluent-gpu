/// <summary>Friendly ERROR state — never the raw exception. A neutral message + a Retry that re-runs the loader.
/// The technical detail goes to the log (visible in the Diagnostics page), not to the user.
/// <para>Same grammar as <see cref="EmptyState"/>, deliberately: display-face headline, one caption line, ONE quiet
/// action. An error is an empty state with a reason, and giving it its own voice (a 32-DIP critical glyph over a
/// smaller heading, an accent Retry) only meant the two surfaces the user meets most often looked unrelated. The
/// critical COLOUR is gone with the glyph — a red pictogram over "Something went wrong" states the same thing twice,
/// and the accent budget's action rung is not what a recovery button is for.</para></summary>

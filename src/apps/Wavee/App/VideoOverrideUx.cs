// Everything the context menu, the Settings roster and the row indicator DECIDE — which rows exist, which status a link
// reports, what a picked file is allowed to be, where a "Locate…" picker should start — lives here, engine-free
// (VideoOverrideService + Wavee.Core + BCL). The engine-bound files (Actions/VideoActions.cs, Menus.cs,
// SettingsPage.VideoOverrides.cs, TrackRow.cs) are thin adapters: they render what this decides and never re-decide it.
// That is what makes the whole P3 surface unit-testable headlessly, exactly like ActionRules/MediaSwitchLogic.

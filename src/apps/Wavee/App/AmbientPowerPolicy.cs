/// Wavee's ambient-cadence POLICY (not a subsystem): when may the always-on ambient motion — the seek playhead, the
/// now-playing equalizer, skeleton shimmer, the buffering spinner, the karaoke lyrics wipe — free-run at the panel's
/// full refresh, and when should it be paced?
///
/// <para><b>The rule.</b> Plugged in AND focused ⇒ <see cref="AmbientRateMode.Uncapped"/> (the user is looking at the
/// app on mains power: give them the display rate). On battery OR unfocused ⇒ <see cref="AmbientRateMode.HalfRefresh"/>
/// (half the panel's live refresh — 60 on a 120 Hz panel, 45 on 90 Hz, 30 on 60 Hz; a whole-vblank divisor, so unlike
/// the old hard-coded 60 it never beats against the vsync-locked present).</para>
///
/// <para><b>Why the two inputs.</b> Battery is the economics an always-open music app actually pays; focus is the
/// attention — a background window's shimmer is worth nothing at any rate. Neither input alone is enough (a plugged-in
/// background window still burns the pipeline; a focused laptop on battery still drains).</para>
///
/// <para><b>Debounce.</b> Power reads are debounced ~2 s (<see cref="DebounceSeconds"/>): an AC blip — a dock
/// re-negotiating, a charger nudged — must not flip the render cadence, which is a visible change. Focus edges apply
/// immediately: they are user-intent, never noise.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Threading.</b> Every entry point runs on the UI thread (the attach site is the pre-loop
/// <c>FluentApp.DiagnosticRun</c> hook; the focus/poll sites are component hooks), and
/// <see cref="AppHost.AmbientRate"/> is a volatile scalar that is documented safe to flip live. No locks.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Escape hatch.</b> <c>FG_ANIM_FPS</c> outranks this policy inside the host (see
/// <see cref="AppHost.AmbientAnimationFps"/>), so a diagnostic capture pinned to a fixed cadence stays pinned.</para>

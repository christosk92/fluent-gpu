/// <see cref="IPreReleaseService"/> resolve rather than assuming what was scheduled last time is still right.

/// <b>Fail-soft.</b> A notifier that throws must never take playback or startup with it: every OS/WinRT call is wrapped,
/// and a machine where toasts are unavailable (elevated process, no AUMID) simply gets no drops.

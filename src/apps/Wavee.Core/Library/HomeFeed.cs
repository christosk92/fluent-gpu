/// <summary>How a home group is laid out. The shape follows the CONTENT, not the section's localized copy: a Hero band
/// (daylist / spotlight), the QuickGrid opener, a finite horizontally paged Shelf, a Featured editorial break, and the
/// content-specific modules — a continuous MixBand of daily mixes, the WeeklyPair (Discover Weekly + Release Radar),
/// ChipCards for seed-listing mixes, a RadioDial of station rows, a RatedShelf of audiobooks, a QueueList of episodes,
/// and the DiscoverFeed that presents single-item baseline recommendations in one paged browse module at the tail.
/// <para>A section whose cards name no shape is never forced into one. It splits per card, and the shapeless remainder
/// lands in QuickGrid — which is why the landing lets that ONE module wear the section's server title when a single
/// section feeds it, instead of filing the title under the app's own "jump back in" copy. A section with no dominant
/// module at all keeps its title on a SectionEntry in the deck. Shelf is the source-neutral plain shelf, available to
/// sources that publish one directly; the Spotify composer emits the two fallbacks above instead.</para></summary>

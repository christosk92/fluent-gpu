// ── The ONLINE-READ seam (hydration façade design §2.7) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The four reads a catalog source cannot answer from its own store: full-catalog search, as-you-type suggestions (both
// shapes), and the editorial/personalized Home feed. They are READS, not hydration — nothing they return is written
// into the Store — which is why they are a seam of their own rather than another rung on IEntityHydrator.
//
// Wiring discipline: no seam is ever null. StoreLibrarySource takes ONE IOnlineCatalog in its ctor and calls it
// unconditionally; the composition root holds a SwitchableOnlineCatalog whose inner is OfflineOnlineCatalog until
// go-live and again after logout. The "am I logged in?" question therefore exists in exactly one place — the seam's
// inner — instead of four `is { } live` probes on the source.

/// return value (null / empty) rather than throwing or being absent.</summary>

/// <b>1. Unread depends on beating a watermark.</b> <c>NotificationMerge.Build</c> gates unread on
/// <c>Timestamp &gt; lastSeenMs</c> — STRICTLY greater — and both feed watermarks are stamped to "now" whenever the panel
/// is opened or Mark-all-read is pressed. A simulated event built with a plain <c>UtcNow</c> immediately after opening the
/// panel would therefore arrive already-read and never escalate. <see cref="NextTimestamp"/> is the fix.
///
/// <b>2. Ids must be unique per event.</b> The merge does not dedup, the panel keys rows on <c>"ntf:" + Id</c>, and the
/// live toast tag is <c>"live:" + Id</c> — so a reused id makes Windows REPLACE the previous banner instead of raising a
/// second one, which looks like "the second press did nothing".
///
/// <b>3. Topic is DERIVED from content, not declared.</b> A social row is classified as a concert only when
/// <see cref="SpotifyUpdates.IsConcert"/> says so (wire type or a concert action target); otherwise it is a follower. An
/// episode needs <see cref="NewReleaseKind.Episode"/>. Get either wrong and the event tests the wrong dial.

// reflection risk, must round-trip a section kind a FUTURE build introduced (unknown kinds deserialize into the record
// and are preserved on the next save — a newer-build layout opened by an older build must not lose data), and the
// property panel wants one uniform shape to edit. Commands (SidebarLayoutCommands.cs) *are* a record hierarchy — they
// are in-memory only and never serialized.

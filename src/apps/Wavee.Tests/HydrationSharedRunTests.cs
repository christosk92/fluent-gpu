// ── One ladder pass is SHARED PROPERTY (design §2.1, the ledger's whole reason to exist) ─────────────────────────────
// Two properties, both of which the first cut of `RunOnce` got wrong, and both of which are invisible until two callers
// actually overlap in time:
//
//   • The batch covers what THIS caller CLAIMED, not what it asked for. Publishing a slot per uri and then letting the
//     first claimant fetch its own whole list means a page open [x,y] and a prefetch [y,z] BOTH fetch y — the exact
//     double-fetch the ledger exists to prevent, and one that no single-caller test can see.
//   • The batch's lifetime belongs to the SESSION, not to whichever caller happened to win the race. Running it on the
//     first caller's token meant a user navigating away cancelled the fetch every joiner was still waiting on, and left
//     the uri unsealed for the next surface to ask all over again.
//
// The gate in each test is what makes the overlap deterministic: caller A cannot finish until the test says so, which
// is the only way caller B is guaranteed to arrive while A is still in flight.

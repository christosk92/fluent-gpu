# Wavee OS-surface bridges

Three siblings hang off `PlaybackBridge.Activate` (UI thread, after the Core subscriptions). They mirror the **unified** now-playing signals — never the engine `IMediaPlayer` — onto Windows chrome, and they all fail soft.

| Bridge | Surface | Cadence | HWND / thread |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SystemMediaControlsBridge` | SMTC flyout, lock screen, hardware keys | metadata on state edge; timeline ~1 Hz via `SmtcTimelineCoalescer` | `FluentApp.WindowHandle`; UI thread. OS callbacks hop through `post`. |
| `TaskbarBridge` | progress bar, play/pause overlay, thumb prev/play-pause/next (ids 1/2/3) | progress ~1 Hz (same coalescer); overlay/thumbs on state edge | same HWND + UI thread. `FluentApp.ThumbButtonClicked` / `TaskbarButtonCreated` (re-`SetThumbButtons` after explorer restart). |
| `JumpListBridge` | Tasks (Resume / Search) + "Jump back in" | track-boundary `OnStateChanged`, capped ~1/min | STA / UI thread. No HWND — Jump List is per-AUMID. |

`WaveeNativeBoot.Install(post)` runs once in the same `Activate` block (after SMTC). It sets `ToastNotifier.Default.ActivationDispatcher`, subscribes `Activated` → `DeepLinkChannel.Post` + `DeepLink.WakeWindow`, then `Register`s a stable CLSID. Registration failure never blocks playback.

## Activation grammar

`wavee://` is the **only** verb these bridges emit or consume. Do not register `spotify:` here.

| Source | Argument |
|---|---|
| Jump List → Resume | `wavee://resume` |
| Jump List → Search | `wavee://open?route=search` |
| Jump List → Jump back in | `wavee://open?route=album:<uri>` / `pl:<uri>` / `artist:<uri>` / `show:<uri>` |
| Toast click | whatever `launch=` / button `arguments=` carried, if it contains `wavee://` |
| Thumb buttons | **not** deep links — they call `IPlaybackPlayer` (Previous / Pause-or-Resume / Next) directly |

Intake is `DeepLinkChannel` (`App/DeepLink.cs`). Cold-launch toast args already land there from `Program.cs`; in-proc clicks need the activator `Register` above.

## Where the next OS mirror goes

1. New type next to the three, same ctor shape `(PlaybackBridge, IPlaybackPlayer, Action<Action> post)`.
2. Construct + `Activate(FluentApp.WindowHandle)` in the existing Windows block in `PlaybackBridge.Activate`.
3. Forward `OnStateChanged` / `OnPositionChanged` from `PushState` / `PushPosition` — the two call sites already sit next to the SMTC lines.
4. Edge-dedupe; reuse `SmtcTimelineCoalescer` for any ~1 Hz shell put; zero alloc on the position tick.
5. Emit `wavee://` (or call `IPlaybackPlayer`). Never a second intake.

Jump List category rows read `PlayLogStore` (via `PlaybackBridge.PlayLog`). Optional navigation recents: `JumpListBridge.AttachHistory(HistoryStore)` from the shell once it has the store — do not invent a fourth log.

Glyphs: `src/apps/Wavee/assets/taskbar/{prev,play,pause,next}.ico` (already globbed by the csproj `assets\**\*` Content include). Missing files skip the glyph; tooltips still work.

Toast CLSID (packaged manifest must match): `C8E4A91B-3D52-4F07-9B6A-1E7C4D8F2A30` (`WaveeNativeBoot.ToastActivatorClsid`).

## Not a playback bridge: `ReleaseNotifier` (scheduled pre-save drops)

`App/ReleaseNotifier.cs` is the fourth OS surface but hangs off the **library**, not `PlaybackBridge` — its trigger is a pre-save, not a track change. Attached from `WaveeApp` beside `PowerBridge.Attach`.

| Aspect | Rule |
|---|---|
| Delivery | `ToastNotifier.Schedule` — the **OS** holds the timer, so the toast fires with Wavee closed. No background task, service or tray resident is involved (and none is needed for this). |
| Opt-in | `WaveeSettings.NotifyReleaseDrops`, default **off**. Turning it off calls `UnscheduleAll()` — a switch that only gated future writes would still let yesterday's entries fire. |
| Trigger | `LibraryBridge.SetSaved` → `ReleaseNotifier.OnSavedChanged(uri, saved)`. That is the one chokepoint every heart / menu item / drop target already goes through; non-`spotify:prerelease:` uris no-op. |
| Reconcile | Every launch (`Attach` → `RequestReconcile`) rebuilds from the live saved-set + a fresh `IPreReleaseService` resolve. **Never trust what was scheduled last run**: dates slip, albums drop, users un-pre-save. Tags are stable (`drop:<prerelease-uri>`) so a reconcile REPLACES its own earlier entry instead of stacking duplicates. |
| Staleness | Gate on `PreReleaseLink.IsUpcoming`, never on the link merely existing — the kind-138 payload has a 30-day offline TTL, so a cached link outlives its own release. |
| Play target | `link.AlbumUri`, not the prerelease uri: the two ids are unrelated and only the album resolves once the record is out. |
| Cover | `ToastImageCache.Default.Localize(url)` — the unpackaged AUMID hero path rejects `http(s)`. A failed localize drops the hero, never the toast. |

**Still missing (T1.6 second half):** the `TimeTrigger` background task that would *discover* things while closed (a rotated daylist, a followed-artist release that did not exist at schedule time). That needs a packaged (MSIX) identity — `BackgroundTaskBuilder` and `windows.backgroundTasks` are unavailable unpackaged — plus a full-trust COM server and manifest entries in the `ops/` AppxManifest sources. Scheduled drops deliberately do **not** depend on it.

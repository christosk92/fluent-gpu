# Wavee playlist mutations (wire + sync)

The write half of the library: every playlist and rootlist edit Wavee sends, every playlist frame the dealer
sends back, and the invariants that keep the two from corrupting each other.

**Read this before touching:** `Backend/Playlists/**`, `Backend/Mutation.cs`, `Backend/Sync/LibrarySync.cs`
(playlist/rootlist/permission arms), `Backend/Realtime/DealerRouter.cs`, `IPlaylistMutationSource`
(`Wavee.Core/Sources/SeamPorts.cs:74`), or the detail page's edit/reorder/notice surfaces.

Every wire shape below is **desktop-verified** against two Fiddler captures + one dealer archive (2026-08-15)
and pinned by byte-exact goldens. Design record: `docs/plans/wavee/playlist-saz-fable5-handoff.md` (read its
**Errata** section first — the original body is wrong on several load-bearing points).

## 1. Outbound wire contracts

**Envelope** (`PlaylistWireMapper.Build`, `:214`) — `POST /playlist/v2/{path}/changes`, body = raw `ListChanges`
under a lying `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` (`SpotifyHeaders.PlaylistV2Mutation`):

| Part | Shape | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `ListChanges` | `base_revision`, one `Delta`, `want_resulting_revisions=1`, `want_sync_result=1`, `nonces=[n]` | exactly ONE nonce; desktop's is a per-list per-session counter, ours is random |
| `Delta` | `ops[]` + `info` | **no `base_version`** — the top-level base is the base |
| `ChangeInfo` | `{user, timestamp}` **only** | never admin/undo/merge/redo/source |
| sync-reason header | `CAk=`(9) edit · `CAw=`(12) create · `CAI=`(2) lens ADD | `spotify-apply-lenses: auto` on playlist, not rootlist |

**Ops** (`ToWireOp` `:252`):

- **ADD** — `attrs{timestamp, item_id}` per item; `add_first`/`add_last` emitted only when true, else `from_index`.
  `item_id`s are **client-minted** (`SpotifyIds.NewItemId`, 8 random bytes) and the server **keeps them**
  (verified: A046's 50 ids came back byte-identical on the next GET). `added_by` is never sent.
- **Keyed REM** — `Rem{items_as_key=1, items:[Item{uri, attrs{item_id}}]}`, **one op per row**, all in one Delta.
  No index at all. Index REM (`from,length`) is the fallback for rows whose id we never learned — all-or-nothing
  per batch (`PlaylistMutationSource.BuildRemoveOps` `:176`), because mixing shapes in one Delta shifts indices.
- **Keyed MOV** — `Mov{items[], add_after_item | add_first | add_last}`, **fields 1–3 absent**. Anchor derivation
  lives in `PlaylistMutationSource.BuildKeyedMove` `:218`: `toIndex<=0`→`add_first`; `>=Count`→`add_last`; else the
  row at `toIndex-1` **walking back over rows that are themselves moving** (that is what makes a gapped multi-select
  land as one contiguous run); nothing left → `add_first`. One op for the whole selection.
- **UPDATE_LIST** — `new_attributes` only. `collaborative=false` and `deleted_by_owner=false` travel as *values*,
  never also as `no_value` (the `no_value` form is parse-side only — it is what the dealer's `old_attributes` uses).
- **Rootlist ops are positional** — `Mov{from,length,to}`, index `Rem`, index `Add`. Playlist row ADD carries
  `attrs{ts, public=1}`; folder markers never carry `public` (`IsGroupMarker` `:359`).

**Create** (`BuildCreateChanges` `:180`) — `POST /playlist/v2/playlist/{clientMintedId}/changes` against the
**8-byte** base `00000000726f6f74` (`PlaylistRevisions.CreateBase`), one `UPDATE_LIST{name}` op, sync-reason 12.
The base is deliberately not 24 B, so the dealer's create echo (which carries the same 8 B as `parent_revision`)
just fails every equality gate. The response has **no name and no contents** — the store is seeded optimistically.

**Folder CRUD** (`RootlistOps`, pure builders `:279`–`:337`) — one Delta each:
- create: `ADD{from=i, start-group{ts}}` + `ADD{from=i+1, end-group{ts}}`; name is escaped into the marker uri.
- rename: `REM{from=start, len=1}` **with no items** + `ADD{from=start, start-group', attrs{ts = the marker's
  ORIGINAL create ts}}`. A resident row with no ts forces a bootstrap GET first (`RenameFolderAsync` `:546`).
- delete: `REM{end,1}` then `REM{start,1}` — children stay and belong to the enclosing level.
  **REFERENCE-INFERRED, not desktop-captured** (see §8).

**Permission** (`PlaylistPermissionClient`) — proto, not JSON, not revision-chained:
`GET /playlist-permission/v1/playlist/{id}/permission/base` → `Permission{revision(8 B or "default"), level}`
(404 = fresh playlist → null). `POST …/permission/base/level` body = `SetPermissionLevelRequest`, literally
`08 01` (BLOCKED) / `08 02` (VIEWER) → `SetPermissionResponse.resulting_permission`. 409 → one GET + one retry,
then `Conflict`; 403 → `Forbidden`. The client is **stateless** — the revision lives on the store header.
Contributor grants are JSON on **`Channel.SpclientWg`** (`permissionLevel` nested under `"permission"`).

**Response handling** — playlist `/changes` replies are zstd, rootlist single-delta replies plain: sniff magic
(`SpotifyZstd.MaybeDecompressZstd`). `multiple_heads(9)` / `changes_require_resync(20)` → resync, never advance.

## 2. Inbound (dealer) contracts — `DealerRouter`

| Topic | Payload as it really arrives | Handling |
|---|---|---|
| `hm://playlist/{v2/,}user/{u}/rootlist` | head-only **`PlaylistModificationInfo`** (uri + 24-B `new_revision`, no parent, no ops), delivered **twice** (v2 + non-v2) | `TryDecodeRootlistPush` `:146` sniffs PMI-vs-RMI by "is field 1 a `spotify:` uri"; 24-B gate; 4-slot `RecentHeadRing` dedups the pair → one enqueue per head |
| `hm://playlist/v2/playlist/{id}` | PMI: echo / ops / head-only / tombstone | `OnPlaylist` `:94`; head-only = "new head", not signal regeneration |
| tombstone | `UPDATE_LIST new{deleted_by_owner=1} old{no_value[6]}` | `CarriesTombstone` → `ApplyTombstone` |
| `hm://playlist-permission/v1/playlist/{id}/permission/state` | `PermissionStatePub` (carries **no uri** — it comes from the topic) | `OnPermission` `:53` → `PlaylistPermissionPush`; missing `base_permission` = logged drop |
| `hm://playlist/v2/list/liked-songs-artist/…` | non-playlist uri, no revision, no ops | logged drop `no-head-no-ops` |

The rootlist push is a **revision hint**, not a delta: it never carries ops, so it can only echo-drop or trigger a
GET. A real ops-carrying `RootlistModificationInfo` is still supported via the fallthrough.
Drop reasons: `unparseable`, `no-uri`, `not-a-spotify-uri`, `unsupported-op`, `no-head-no-ops`, `bad-revision:{len}`.
`DealerArchive.IsHandled` labels both `hm://playlist/` and `hm://playlist-permission/`.

## 3. The gate trees (exactly as in code)

`LibrarySync.RootlistPushAsync` `:323` — ordered, total, and unable to store a non-24-B head:
1. `!IsWellFormed(newRev)` → full GET (defensive; the router already drops these).
2. `Equal(stored, newRev)` → echo drop.
3. `ops.Count>0 && Equal(stored, parentRev)` → apply in place → `SetRootlist(entries, newRev)`; torn → full GET.
4. else → full GET (`head-only` / `parent-mismatch`). **An empty-ops push never calls the 2-arg `SetRootlist`.**

`LibrarySync.PlaylistPushAsync` `:523`:
1. `Equal(stored, newRev)` → echo drop.
2. tombstone → `ApplyTombstone` — deliberately **before** the pending gate (a deleted list cannot be converged).
3. **pending gate (I3a)**: `_mutations.PendingFor(uri) > 0` → `MarkDirty` only. No in-place apply, no revalidate.
4. new head (well-formed `newRev`, no usable parent, no ops) → open: `PlaylistRevalidateAsync`; cold: `MarkDirty`.
5. resident + `Equal(stored, parentRev)` → apply ops in place, hydrate only the added uris, header refetch if the
   batch carries UPDATE_LIST; adopt `newRev` only when well-formed.
6. else → open: revalidate; cold: mark dirty (anti-herd).

`LibrarySync.ApplyTombstone` `:618` — ONE bulk: rootlist row removed **revision-preservingly**, saved pill false,
membership emptied, header latched `DeletedByOwner=true`, `Bump(uri)` + `Bump("rootlist")`. Idempotent.

`LibrarySync.PermissionPushAsync` `:639` — cold header → ignored (`PermissionPushIgnored`, seeded on open by
`SeedPermissionAsync` `:662`, the ONE place a permission GET happens). Resident → writes `IsPublic`,
`BasePermissionRevision`, `Capabilities.IsCollaborative`, zero network.

`LibrarySync.HealRootlistRevision` `:378` — at sync start, before the drain: a persisted non-24-B rootlist revision
is cleared so hydrate's full GET rewrites SQLite meta.

`MutationEngine.AdoptSnapshot` `:649` / `LibrarySync.AdoptSnapshot` `:679` — the single membership-replace
chokepoint: I1-gate the revision, `SetMembership`, then `ReapplyPending(uri)` `:668` (still-pending ops re-applied
in id order on top; one that no longer fits dead-letters `Conflict`, it is never rolled back).

`OpRebaseStrategy.CaptureChangesResponse` `:249` — the I4 order:
(a) `multiple_heads || changes_require_resync` → `PlaylistResyncQueue.Mark`, revision **unchanged**;
(b) `sync_result` ops → apply to local membership **first**, then adopt `resulting_revisions[^1]` (torn → mark, no
advance); (c) full contents → replace + adopt; (d) rev-only (empty `sync_result`) → advance the revision only.
The queue is drained right after `Drain` on the sync loop (`LibrarySync` `:887`).

`MutationEngine.Drain` `:774` — **ordered per entity**: an op that did not land blocks every later op on the same
entity this pass (that is what keeps create → rootlist ADD → seed tracks in order). A
`PlaylistMutationException` from a strategy = terminal → rollback + dead-letter immediately, no attempt burn;
everything else is retryable with exponential backoff (`min(60s, 2^attempts)`), 10 attempts then dead-letter.
Terminal kinds are recorded per edit id and rethrown once by `PlaylistMutationSource.DrainAsync` `:470`
(still queued afterwards → `Offline` when the transport is the stub / there is no account, else `Pending`).

## 4. Invariants I1–I8

- **I1 revision well-formedness** — a stored playlist/rootlist revision is always 24 B (`PlaylistRevisions`).
  The 8-B create base and the 8-B/"default" permission revision never enter those slots; malformed persisted
  state self-heals to null → full GET.
- **I2 one writer per entity** — network membership/rootlist writes only on the `LibrarySync` loop; **every**
  rootlist write takes `RootlistLane` (direct ops in `PlaylistMutationSource`, and `RootlistFollowStrategy.Replay`
  takes it itself, inside the strategy).
- **I3 local intent wins until acked** — (a) pending > 0 → pushes mark dirty, never apply in place;
  (b) every snapshot replace ends in `ReapplyPending`; (c) dead-letter rollback restores the pre-edit snapshot.
- **I4 never advance a revision past ops you did not apply** — see `CaptureChangesResponse` above.
- **I5 index ops are base-bound** — `RebaseOps` `:183`: ADD `from_index` recomputed from its recorded
  `wavee_anchor_item_id` (anchor gone → append); index REM re-expressed as keyed when every row has an id, else
  **terminal `Conflict`**. Keyed ops pass through untouched. Rootlist structural ops are index ops by nature →
  **online-only** (`RequireOnline`), lane-serialized, 409 → rebuild-against-fresh ×2 → `Conflict`.
- **I6 echo suppression is by revision only** — stored == resulting rev → drop. Keyed ADD is additionally
  idempotent by `item_id`.
- **I7 every inbound frame is accounted for** — parse failure / bad head / unknown shape → logged drop with a
  reason (`PlaylistMutationDiagnostics.DealerDrop`, `RootlistPushDeduped`). Nothing is swallowed.
- **I8 reconnect closes gaps** — `ReconnectResync` revalidates rootlist + open/dirty playlists; pending drains first.

## 5. Operation × hazard matrix

| Op | Wire | Optimistic / ack / echo | Hazards handled |
|---|---|---|---|
| Add tracks | `ADD{add_last}` / `ADD{from_index}`, `attrs{ts, item_id}` | membership + minted ids inline; ack = rev (+`sync_result`) | insert rebase by anchor (I5); duplicates legal (independent ids); deleted/forbidden → terminal |
| Remove rows | N× keyed `REM` in one Delta | rows removed inline by id | duplicates disambiguated; row gone remotely → torn → refetch → reapply is a no-op; unkeyed rows → index fallback (I5) |
| Move rows | ONE keyed `MOV` (gapped selection included) | applied inline with the same op | anchor removed concurrently → torn → refetch → reapply; unkeyed row/anchor → `Pending` refusal, **never** a positional fallback; dealer echo arrives positional → dropped by rev / deferred by I3 |
| Update details / cover | `UPDATE_LIST{name\|description\|picture\|collaborative}` | header patch inline | header refetch when a push's ops contain UPDATE_LIST |
| Create playlist | create-`/changes` (8-B base) → rootlist `ADD{attrs{ts,public=1}}` → seeds | store row + empty membership + rootlist entry inline; ordered outbox ops | offline create queues; 4xx → terminal, rollback + the rest of the recipe dropped (no orphan row); echo parent is 8 B |
| Delete playlist | rootlist index `REM{from,len=1}` | rootlist entry + saved pill evicted | tombstone push also arrives (idempotent); pending edits → terminal `Deleted` |
| Follow / unfollow | rootlist `ADD` / keyed `REM` | pill + entry inline, rev-preserving | I2 lane; ADD index resolved from the folder at replay, not at enqueue |
| Rootlist reorder / folder CRUD | positional `MOV` / marker `ADD`+`REM` | tree computed **locally** (the reply has no contents) | 409 → rebuild ×2 → `Conflict`; online-only |
| Set permission | proto `POST …/base/level` | header `IsPublic` inline + best-effort rootlist `UPDATE_ITEM{public}` | 409 → GET + retry once; 403 → `Forbidden`; dealer `permission/state` converges |
| Contributor invite | JSON grant on `SpclientWg` | — | no dealer topic — the HTTP response is the only ack |
| Inbound rootlist / playlist / permission push | see §2 | — | §3 gate trees |

## 6. Item ids and revisions

`SpotifyIds` — `NewItemId()` 8 bytes → 16 hex, `NewPlaylistId()` 16 bytes → base62/22, `NewGroupId()` 8 bytes → hex.
`PlaylistRevisions.IsWellFormed` is the single gate; `Equal` treats two nulls as **not** equal (unknown must never
read as an echo). Every revision writer routes through it: `PlaylistFetcher.StorableRevision`,
`CaptureChangesResponse`, `MutationEngine.AdoptSnapshot`, both push handlers, `HealRootlistRevision`.

## 7. Seam + UI surface

`IPlaylistMutationSource` (`SeamPorts.cs:74`) as landed. Note the shapes that differ from the design doc:
`MoveRowsAsync(uri, rows, **int toIndex**, ct)` — the anchor is derived **in the backend** by `BuildKeyedMove`;
`CreatePlaylist(name, placement)` is **synchronous** and returns `PlaylistCreated(Uri, Completion)` (the optimistic
row is already in the store); folder CRUD is `CreateFolderAsync` / `RenameFolderAsync` / `DeleteFolderAsync`.
Stubs (`LocalPlaylistMutationSource`) implement the new members as named `NotSupportedException` throws.

**Failures**: everything that reaches UI is a `PlaylistMutationException{Kind}`
(`Unknown, Conflict, Forbidden, Deleted, Offline, Pending, NotSupported`). Classification is
`PlaylistEditErrorKinds.KindOf` (`Features/Detail/PlaylistEditErrorKinds.cs:26`); copy is `KeyFor(kind, verb)` `:45`
with `PlaylistEditVerb {Generic, Add, Remove, Reorder, Rename}`; `PlaylistEditErrors.Toast` renders it and
`IsInformational` (Offline/Pending) picks the severity. **There is no `ex.Message` fallthrough** — Unknown maps to
`detail.edit.failed`.

| Kind | Loc key | Reorder variant |
|---|---|---|
| Conflict | `detail.edit.conflict` | `detail.edit.reorderConflict` |
| Forbidden | `detail.edit.forbidden` | — |
| Deleted | `detail.edit.deletedElsewhere` | — |
| Offline | `detail.edit.queuedOffline` (info) | — |
| Pending | `detail.edit.pendingSync` (info) | `drag.stillSyncing` |
| NotSupported | `detail.edit.offlineSpotifyEdits` | — |
| Unknown | `detail.edit.failed` | — |

**Store header fields the UI reads** (`Wavee.Core/Domain/Models.cs:419`): `IsPublic`, `BasePermissionRevision`,
`Capabilities.IsCollaborative`, `DeletedByOwner`. The detail page never issues its own permission GET.

**Notice**: `DetailNotice {None, Deleted, AccessRevoked, CreateFailed}` (`PlaylistPageNoticeRules.cs:7`), decided by
the pure `PlaylistPageNoticeRules.Next(...)` / `.Cold(...)`, rendered by `PlaylistNoticeBar` in `DetailShell`, and
gating every edit affordance through `PlaylistInlineEdit.Editable`.

**Pending chip**: `MutationEngine.PendingChanged`/`PendingFor` → `LibraryBridge.PendingEdits(uri)` +
`PendingEditsTotal` → `PlaylistPendingChip` in the header and one line in `NotificationPanel`.

**Reorder gate** (`PlaylistReorderRules` + `PlaylistDropRefusalRules` in `Features/DragDrop/WaveeDragRules.cs:106`)
is **split**: the rows half refuses at the drop verdict (`PlaylistDropRefusal.Syncing`); the anchor half is checked
at commit in `DepositAtAsync`, the first moment a slot exists. `TryBlockMove` (keyboard) checks both up front.

### Rootlist moves — the two legality checkers, and the one commit

**The check is deliberately split across two layers, over two different data structures:**

| | `RootlistOps.CheckMove` / `TryBuildMove(…, out RootlistMoveCheck)` | `RootlistTreeMoves.Check` |
|---|---|---|
| lives in | `Backend/Playlists/RootlistOps.cs` (backend, engine-free) | `Features/Sidebar/Data/RootlistSlotResolver.cs` (UI, engine-free) |
| decides over | the **flat marker stream** (`RootlistEntry[]` — a folder is a balanced `start-group`/`end-group` pair) | the **depth-first flattened projection tree** (`SidebarProjectionInput.PlaylistTree`) |
| answers with | `RootlistMoveCheck {Ok, Missing, SameItem, Invalid, NoOp, Cycle}` | `SidebarDropRefusal {…, NoOp, IntoItself, IntoDescendant}` |
| when | at build time, the authority on the index math that ships | at **hover**, so the cue can refuse *before* the drop |

They agree by construction rather than by duplication: an entry's half-open span is "itself plus every following
entry deeper than it" on the tree side and "everything the balanced marker pair encloses" on the stream side — the
same rows — and both compute the destination with the same three-way placement rule
(`Before ⇒ targetFrom`, `After ⇒ targetEnd`, `Inside ⇒ append`). Neither is a copy of the other's *math*; the tree
side exists because `TryBuildMove` sits three layers below the pointer and used to reach the user as a bare
`false` — nothing happened, no toast, no cue. Adding a reason to `TryBuildMove` (the 6-arg overload; the 4-arg one
is kept for `PlaylistMoveOpsTests`) is what let the refusal be *named* at all.

**One chokepoint.** Every rootlist move in the app — a sidebar drop, a collapsed-rail folder drop, the row menu's
Move up / Move down / **Move to folder…** / Move out of, and Alt+↑/↓ — resolves its `(RootlistItemRef, placement)`
and then calls **`WaveeResourceDrop.MoveRootlist` → `LibraryBridge.MoveRootlistItemAsync`**; the four non-mouse
verbs funnel through `FolderActions.Commit` first. There is no second mutation path, which is why every one of them
awaits the seam, maps a failure by verb (`PlaylistEditVerb.Reorder`, never `ex.Message`), announces through
`Announcer`, and shows a `drag.movedTo` / `drag.movedToLibrary` toast.

**Undo anchors.** `RootlistUndoAnchors.TryResolve(tree, entryId, out anchor, out placement)` is captured **before**
the mutation — once the rootlist has moved, where the item used to be is unknowable. It resolves to the previous
sibling (`After`), else the next sibling (`Before`), else the parent folder (`Inside`), and returns `false` for the
tree's only top-level member; the toast then appears **without** an Undo rather than with one that would land
somewhere else. The inverse is an ordinary `MoveRootlistItemAsync` on the same seam.

UI contract for the drop cue itself (resolver, geometry, refusal captions, the mid-drag freeze):
`.claude/skills/wavee-sidebar/architecture.md` § *Rootlist drag & drop*.

## 8. Test infra

**Dealer replay** — `Wavee.Tests/Backend/DealerArchiveReplay.cs` loads `Fixtures/dealer/playlist-20260815.{idx.ndjson,bin}`
(a byte-exact `hm://playlist*` subset of a real session, re-offset into its own `.bin`), runs the rows through the
**real** `DealerFrameParser`, and pushes them into a real `DealerRouter` + `LibrarySync` over a `StubTransport` with
a scripted server. `DealerReplayTests` pins: 75 frames / 36 rootlist / 18 distinct heads each delivered twice;
rootlist revision is 24 B after every frame; ≤18 GETs and `RootlistPushDeduped == 18`; a head-only playlist push
does not full-refresh a cold list; the P3 tombstone evicts it everywhere and latches the header; the two permission
pushes flip BLOCKED→VIEWER with **zero** GETs.

**SAZ goldens** — `Wavee.Tests/Fixtures/playlist-wire/*.bin`, manifest + sizes in `WireGoldenFixtures.cs`.
Each is the raw HTTP **body** (everything after the first `\r\n\r\n`, `Content-Length` verified at extraction,
zstd-decompressed where the capture was compressed); no headers, no bearer token — `WireGoldenTests` asserts that.

| Golden | What | Byte-exact rebuild? |
|---|---|---|
| `a031-create-p1` | create via `/changes`, 8-B base | yes (`PlaylistCreateTests`) |
| `a042-rootlist-add-p1` | rootlist ADD, `attrs{ts, public}` | yes |
| `a046-add-50-tracks` | ADD `add_last`, 50 minted item_ids | yes |
| `a143-keyed-rem-x3` | one Delta, three keyed REMs | yes |
| `a148 / a154 / a498` | keyed MOV: after_item / add_first / add_last | yes |
| `a164-folder-create` | two marker ADDs, one Delta, no `public` | yes |
| `a281-rootlist-index-rem` | delete playlist: index REM | yes |
| `b037 / b128` | folder rename (inner / outer), original ts | yes |
| `b049-rootlist-mov` | positional `MOV{from,len,to}` | yes |
| `b063-update-list-name` | UPDATE_LIST name | yes |
| `b078 / b108` | `SetPermissionLevelRequest` = `08 01` / `08 02` | yes (`PlaylistPermissionTests`) |
| `a178-create-response` | create reply: rev bookkeeping, no name/contents | parse-only |
| `a164-folder-create-response` | rootlist reply, uncompressed, no contents | parse-only |
| `perm-get-blocked` | `Permission{revision(8 B), BLOCKED}` | parse-only |

**Regenerating**: extract the `.saz` (a zip) → `raw/{prefix}_c.txt` (request) / `_s.txt` (response), take everything
after the first `\r\n\r\n`, verify against `Content-Length`, decompress by **magic** (not `Content-Encoding`), and
write the body alone. Then update `RequestSizes`/`ResponseSizes`.

> **The rule**: a wire change must keep the goldens byte-exact, or come with a new capture. A rebuild assertion that
> "just needs updating" means Wavee no longer sends what desktop sends.

## 9. Known gaps / not captured

- `Mov.add_before_item` (field 5) is declared but **never observed**; `MapOps` rejects it as `unsupported-op`
  rather than reinterpreting it (there is no way to resolve "before X" without the list).
- **Folder delete is reference-inferred**, not desktop-captured — taken from the WaveeMusic `RootlistService`
  (remove both markers, children stay) as the exact inverse of the captured create. Flagged in `BuildDeleteFolder`.
- XM extension kind **225** (playlist metadata, what desktop uses) is unused; Wavee still reads 205.
- `Capabilities` in our proto is a **6-field prefix** of the ~20-field message desktop receives. Unknown fields
  round-trip; nothing reads the missing ones.
- `PlaylistModificationInfo` f5/f6/f8/f9 are observed but undeclared (f5 `{unix-s, nanos}`, f6 a host string).
- **`DeletedByOwner` is not persisted to SQLite** — no column in the v8 schema. It is relearned from the header on
  the next full GET (`PlaylistFetcher.HeaderOf`), and merged forward in-process by `Store.cs:256`.
- `DeletePlaylistAsync` still throws a raw `InvalidOperationException` when the uri is not in the rootlist —
  the one write path that has not been converted to a typed kind.
- The **P3 UI** (create flow, folder-row menu, folder loc keys) is landing separately: the seam, the wire builders,
  the goldens and the tests exist; the sidebar call sites and `sidebar.*folder*` strings may not yet. Rename/new-folder
  reuse the existing `ContainerActions.RenamePlaylist` ContentDialog rather than an inline sidebar editor (sidebar rows
  are recycled `ItemsView` slots that re-plan on every rootlist push and would lose focus mid-push).

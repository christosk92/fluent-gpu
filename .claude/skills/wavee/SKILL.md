name: wavee
description: Wavee Spotify desktop client under src/apps/ (Wavee, Wavee.Core, Wavee.Tests). Use for app architecture, seams, playlist mutations, and build/test commands. Engine work belongs in the repo-root fluentgpu skill.

# Wavee app

Scope: `src/apps/Wavee/**`, `src/apps/Wavee.Core/**`, `src/apps/Wavee.Tests/**` only.

## Build & verify

```powershell
dotnet build src/apps/Wavee/Wavee.csproj
dotnet test src/apps/Wavee.Tests/Wavee.Tests.csproj
```

## Architecture hub

`docs/plans/wavee/` — and within it **`architecture.md` is the seam canon**: the ports (`ICatalogSource`,
`IEntityHydrator`, `IOnlineCatalog`, the playback/remote/session/lyrics/mutation ports), the `SourceRegistry` /
`AggregateCatalog` federation, the ACL rule (no GraphQL/proto type crosses a port), the §9 status matrix and the
§10 file map. Start there for "where does this belong?".

Two pointers that used to conflict, now reconciled:

- `docs/plans/wavee-native-backend-architecture.md` is a **different** doc — the *live Spotify backend* (transport,
  dealer, session, audio). It does not supersede `architecture.md`; read it for wire/session questions.
- Production comments across `Wavee.Core/Sources/**`, `App/**` and `Features/**` cite `docs/architecture.md`, which
  does not exist. They mean `docs/plans/wavee/architecture.md`; the §-numbers still line up.

**Hydration** (every catalog metadata fetch in the app goes through one façade):
[hydration.md](hydration.md) is the how-to. Canon: `docs/plans/wavee/hydration-facade-design.md` (shapes),
`hydration-facade-plan.md` (phases + status), `metadata-entry-points-inventory.md` (what it replaced),
`xm-kind-probe-overview.md` + `xm-playcount-handoff.md` (which extension kind carries what).

## Wiring discipline (mandatory)

Read [wiring-discipline.md](wiring-discipline.md) before any seam/composition-root change. **Never** use optional nullable dependencies with `?? Task.CompletedTask` or empty-string defaults on hot paths.

## Sub-skills

- [hydration.md](hydration.md) — **the metadata façade**: `IEntityHydrator`, the five levels, the per-kind ladders,
  traits + surfaces, the display-only extension reader, and the rules (no `spotify:track:` string tests, no
  per-service memos/caps/etag forks, store-writing = ladder/projector vs return-only = service). Read before adding
  ANY fetch of catalog metadata, a new trait, a new extension read, or a second provider.
- [wiring-discipline.md](wiring-discipline.md) — required deps, fail-loud stubs, go-live hooks
- [home-layout.md](home-layout.md) — Home visibility + order (`home-layout.json`, reducer,
  `HomeLandingProjection`, `HomeCustomizerPage`). Read before adding a landing module.
- [session-restore.md](session-restore.md) — `session.json`: nav stacks **and** the playback session. Write gates,
  the cluster → snapshot → paused restore order, and the uid→uri→index→head identity ladder. Read before touching
  restore, `PlaybackController`'s recovery paths, or anything that decides what plays at launch.
- [audio-handoff.md](audio-handoff.md) — gapless & crossfade: one `IAudioClient` per queue, the 0 ms butt-join vs the
  overlap path, prepared-next timing, codec pre-roll trim, and how to read the `[gapless]` log. Read before touching
  `SpotifyLive/Audio/**` or prepared-next scheduling.
- [notifications.md](notifications.md) — the two channels (bell / Windows), the Off→In-app→Windows ladder, the 8 topic
  dials, quiet hours, the live-escalation watermark and the scheduled-toast reconcile rules. Read before adding a
  notification of any kind.
- [palette-shortcuts.md](palette-shortcuts.md) — the Ctrl+K command palette registry, the shortcut table, `Announcer`.
- [bridges.md](bridges.md) — the OS-mirror bridges hanging off `PlaybackBridge` (SMTC, taskbar, jump list).
- [deep-linking.md](deep-linking.md) — the `wavee://` verb map and the one activation entry every surface routes through.
- [receipts.md](receipts.md) — the About "Wavee right now" perf receipts and the GPU-vs-app memory split.
- [focus-pitfalls.md](focus-pitfalls.md) — programmatic focus: focus the editable node, not its chrome.
- **`wavee-sidebar` skill** (`.claude/skills/wavee-sidebar/`) — the left sidebar: the three designs as documents
  over ONE `SidebarPane` renderer, the layout document/reducer/persistence, the projection→binder→planner
  pipeline, the customizer, and the extension registries. Read it before touching `Features/Sidebar/**`,
  `Wavee.Core/Sidebar/**` or `Actions/Extensibility/**`.
- **`dnd` skill** (`.claude/skills/dnd/`) — **drag & drop**, engine and app. Read it before touching
  `Features/DragDrop/**` (`WaveeResourceDrag` payloads/commit seams, the engine-free `WaveeDragRules` /
  `TabDropRules` decision tables, the chip model, the insertion preview) or any surface that declares a
  `Drag.Source` / `Drop.Target` / `InsertionOptions` / `Reorderable` — the detail track list, the tab strip, the
  player bar, the queue panel and the sidebar rows all do.
- [wavee-playlist-mutations/SKILL.md](wavee-playlist-mutations/SKILL.md) — the playlist/rootlist **write path**: the
  desktop-verified `/changes` wire (keyed REM/MOV, minted `item_id`s, the 8-B create base, folder markers, the
  permission proto dialect), the dealer push gate trees, invariants I1–I8, the durable outbox, and the edit
  affordances/failure copy on the playlist page. Read before changing anything in `Backend/Playlists/**`,
  `Backend/Mutation.cs`, the sync/dealer playlist arms, or `IPlaylistMutationSource`.

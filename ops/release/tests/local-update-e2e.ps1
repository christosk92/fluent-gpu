.SYNOPSIS
  The fully local Wavee auto-update end-to-end test. No GitHub, no tag, no release, no gh.

.DESCRIPTION
  Packages A (an older quad) and B (a newer one) are built with -UpdateBaseUrl http://127.0.0.1:<port>/, dropped into
  a loopback feed served by ops\release\tests\LocalFeedServer.psm1, and driven through the REAL update path.

  There are TWO update paths, and they RACE each other, so the harness runs exactly one per invocation:

    -Scenario inapp  (default)  A is installed from the BARE .msix, so there is no App Installer association and
                                Windows cannot preempt anything. The app's own checker finds B, install-on-quit hands
                                the work to PackageUpdater, and APPLYING the update is what creates the association.
                                This is the only way to observe "update available" and "install-on-quit: staging".

    -Scenario os                A is installed THROUGH the .appinstaller (Add-AppxPackage -AppInstallerFile), which
                                creates the association. The template carries OnLaunch HoursBetweenUpdateChecks="0",
                                so the NEXT activation is intercepted by App Installer: the deployment engine
                                downloads and registers B before Wavee's own code runs. The app never says "update
                                available" - it opens already updated. This is what most users will experience.

  The phases:

      pack A, pack B                     both packed with -FeedRelease wavee-local -UpdateBaseUrl http://127.0.0.1:<port>/
      install A                          bare .msix (inapp) or -AppInstallerFile (os)
      launch A                           the in-app checker GETs the .appinstaller (User-Agent "Wavee/...")
      publish B into the same feed       same file name, higher root Version, MainPackage/@Uri -> B
      drive                              inapp: install-on-quit (or About > Update now); os: just relaunch
      Windows downloads + installs B     the DEPLOYMENT engine GETs the .msix over loopback, in Range slices
      relaunch                           "updated: <A> -> <B>", the after-update plate, previousVersion == A

  The loopback listener's request log is the evidence for the two claims that a package version alone cannot prove:
  that the IN-APP checker fetched the feed, and that the DEPLOYMENT ENGINE (a different User-Agent) downloaded the
  package. Nothing here is a production branch: http/https is all the app's shared HTTP client speaks, so serving the
  feed on 127.0.0.1 exercises exactly the code that ships.

  Every phase is recorded into a PASS / WARN / FAIL table printed at the end; the exit code is the FAIL count. The
  finally block always stops the app, copies the logs, stops the listener and unloads the settings hive.

    .SYNOPSIS
      Is this package associated with the .appinstaller? Three INDEPENDENT proofs; ANY one of them is enough.
    .DESCRIPTION
      1. cmdlet     Get-AppxPackageAutoUpdateSettings, both selector forms (Get-AutoUpdateSettings).
      2. feed log   an "App Virt Client" GET of the feed document after $Since - the deployment engine fetching the
                    .appinstaller, which it only ever does for a package that is associated with one.
      3. event log  AppXDeploymentServer/Operational id 603 for this package family after $Since, AND ONLY where the
                    message names UpdateUsingAppInstallerOperation. A 603 is written for every deployment operation
                    (a bare Add-AppxPackage writes AddPackageOperation), so an unfiltered 603 count is not evidence
                    of anything - it made P6 "prove" an association from the bare install it had just performed.

      Proof 1 has been observed answering "no" while 2 and 3 both said yes on the same launch, which is exactly why
      the verdict is an OR and the detail names WHICH proofs held. The caller records the two that did not as INFO
      rows rather than losing them.

      Run 2 embedded and served the authored ops\release\wavee\<semver>\whatsnew.json straight from disk. That file is
      an INPUT: "sections" is empty, "date" and "packageVersion" are empty strings, and the links are blank - so the
      app showed a plate with no changelog sections and no version pill, and the harness was rehearsing a document
      shape that never ships. The real pipeline runs the notes through the release tool first, and so does this.

      No token is passed. The tool warns that issue lookups are unauthenticated and continues; the authored notes
      carry no issue references, so nothing is unresolved.

      Returns a pscustomobject @{ Ok; Dir; Index; Detail }. Ok=$false means the caller falls back to the authored
      folder - a degraded rehearsal is still worth running, and the Detail says why it was degraded.

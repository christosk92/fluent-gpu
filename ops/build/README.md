# Packaging & release pipeline

Build, sign, and publish the two shipping apps in this tree — **FluentGpu Gallery** and **Wavee** — as MSIX packages. FluentGpu is a **NativeAOT plain‑Win32 full‑trust** app
(no WindowsAppSDK / WinUI / XAML), so packaging goes straight through `MakeAppx` — and the package is a single
**~7 MB native binary** with **no bundled .NET runtime** (compare WaveeMusic's WinUI self‑contained JIT at ~200 MB).

## Files

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `pack-msix.ps1` | End‑to‑end local build: `dotnet publish` (AOT) → stage layout → `makepri` → `makeappx pack` → `signtool sign` → `.msix` |
| `AppxManifest.xml` | MSIX manifest template (packaged Win32 full‑trust; `__PUBLISHER__`/`__VERSION__`/`__ARCH__` substituted) |
| `AppInstaller.template.xml` | `.appinstaller` template for one‑click sideload **auto‑update** |
| `generate-appicon.ps1` | Regenerates the multi‑res app `.ico` + MSIX tile logos from `appicon-source.png` |
| `generate-download-buttons.ps1` | Regenerates the README "Download" button PNGs (x64/arm64 × light/dark) |
| `../.github/workflows/msix.yml` | CI: matrix arm64+x64 → (optional Trusted Signing) → GitHub Release + `.appinstaller` |
| **`pack-wavee-msix.ps1`** | Same pipeline for the **Wavee** app: `dotnet publish` (AOT) → stage → third‑party notices → `makepri` → `makeappx` → `signtool` → `Wavee_<quad>_<arch>.msix` |
| **`Wavee.AppxManifest.xml`** | Wavee's MSIX manifest template — identity `cproducts.Wavee`, the `wavee://` protocol + toast activation declarations |
| **`Wavee.AppInstaller.template.xml`** | Wavee's `.appinstaller` template (`__VERSION__`/`__ARCH__`/`__PUBLISHER__`/`__APPINSTALLER_URI__`/`__MSIX_URI__`) |
| **`publish-wavee-aot.ps1`** | Plain NativeAOT publish of Wavee (no packaging) — the fast "does AOT still link?" loop |
| **`Wavee.Build.psm1`** | Shared build helpers imported by both pack scripts *and* by `ops/release/wavee-release.ps1`: `Get-WindowsSdkTools`, `Add-VsInstallerToPath`, `Test-X64CrossToolchain`, `Get-WaveeVersionProps` / `Set-WaveeBuild`, `Invoke-Native`, `Invoke-TrustedSigning` / `Invoke-DevCertSigning`, `Test-MsixSignature`, `Get-MsixIdentity`, `Get-PeMachine` / `Test-PeMachine` |
| **`../release/`** | The Wavee **release** orchestrator (`wavee-release.ps1`), its pure helpers (`Wavee.Release.psm1`), the feed-release body, the per-version notes folders, and the Pester tests — Wavee has **no** CI release job |

## Local build

```powershell
# Host arch, NativeAOT, self-signed dev cert → artifacts\FluentGpu.WindowsApp_0.1.0.0_<arch>.msix
pwsh ops/build/pack-msix.ps1

pwsh ops/build/pack-msix.ps1 -Arch x64 -Version 0.2.0.0   # pick arch / version (4-part)
pwsh ops/build/pack-msix.ps1 -Install                     # build, sign, trust the dev cert, Add-AppxPackage (run elevated)
pwsh ops/build/pack-msix.ps1 -NoAot                        # framework-dependent self-contained (fast iteration; not release)
pwsh ops/build/pack-msix.ps1 -NoSign                       # leave unsigned (CI re-signs with Trusted Signing)
```

NativeAOT is the **csproj default** (`<PublishAot>true</PublishAot>` in `FluentGpu.WindowsApp.csproj`) — it engages only at
`dotnet publish`; `dotnet build`/`dotnet run` stay fast JIT. AOT's native link needs MSVC `link.exe`; the script adds the
VS Installer dir to `PATH` so ILC can find it via `vswhere`. Requires the **Windows SDK** (`makeappx`/`makepri`/`signtool`).

### Installing a self‑signed build

`signtool verify /pa` reports the chain as untrusted until the dev cert is installed — expected. `-Install` imports the
cert into `LocalMachine\TrustedPeople` (needs an elevated shell) and runs `Add-AppxPackage`. To trust it manually, import
the cert (subject `CN=MarTeco Dev, …`) into **Local Machine → Trusted People**, then double‑click the `.msix`.

## Wavee

The **Wavee** music client packages through the same pipeline with its own script, manifest, template, and package
identity (`cproducts.Wavee`) — and its own tag prefix, so Wavee and the gallery release independently.

```powershell
pwsh ops/build/pack-wavee-msix.ps1                                       # dev pack: host arch, dev cert → artifacts\Wavee_<quad>_<arch>.msix
pwsh ops/build/pack-wavee-msix.ps1 -Arch x64 -NoSign -OutputDir artifacts\x64-probe   # cross-arch probe, unsigned
pwsh ops/build/pack-wavee-msix.ps1 -Install                              # build, sign, trust the dev cert, Add-AppxPackage (elevated)
pwsh ops/build/pack-wavee-msix.ps1 -TrustedSigning                       # Azure Trusted Signing (publicly trusted)
pwsh ops/build/pack-wavee-msix.ps1 -NoAot                                # self-contained JIT if AOT cannot target this arch
```

**A zero-flag run is a dev pack.** Version identity comes from `src/apps/Wavee/Wavee.Version.props`, so nothing has to
be passed: the MSIX quad is `<WaveeVersion core>.<WaveeBuild>`, the channel is `dev`, and `InformationalVersion` is
`<semver>+build.<N>.sha.<sha7>`. **Nothing here bumps `<WaveeBuild>`** — only `ops/release/wavee-release.ps1` does.

A real release passes every value explicitly; these are the flags it uses:

| Flag | What it stamps |
|---|---|
| `-Quad M.m.p.N` | MSIX `Identity/@Version` (4 numeric parts, each ≤65535) — the only thing Windows compares |
| `-Semver X.Y.Z` | `InformationalVersion` (default: the props `<WaveeVersion>`) |
| `-Channel stable\|beta\|dev` | `AssemblyMetadata Channel`; drives the About channel pill |
| `-Codename <name>` | `AssemblyMetadata Codename` (default: the props `<WaveeCodename>`) |
| `-IdentityName` / `-DisplayName` / `-Protocol` | manifest `Identity/@Name` (`cproducts.Wavee`), display name, and the `wavee://` scheme — a beta identity would vary all three |
| `-Commit <sha7>` / `-BuildDate <iso>` | About receipts and the crash header (both default from git / UTC now) |
| `-NotesDir <dir>` | copies the validated release notes into `layout\Assets\whatsnew\`, so the installed app can show its **own** What's new page with no network |
| `-FeedRelease <name>` | the rolling GitHub release whose `.appinstaller` this package polls (default `wavee-stable`) — build-time metadata, never a runtime switch, which is how an E2E test package targets `wavee-stable-test` |
| `-UpdateBaseUrl <url>` | `AssemblyMetadata UpdateBaseUrl` — the root the feed and the release-notes documents hang off (default `https://github.com/christosk92/fluent-gpu/releases/download/`). Absolute http(s); plain `http` is accepted only for a loopback host, which is how `ops/release/tests/local-update-e2e.ps1` packs a build that polls `http://127.0.0.1:8099/` |
| `-PublicOnly` | `-p:WaveeSkipPrivateSources=true` — builds without PlayPlay |

The script verifies what it produced: every `.exe`/`.dll` in the layout must have the right PE machine type, and the
packed manifest's identity name / version / arch must match what was asked for.

**Third‑party notices.** The script generates `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt` into the publish directory (so it ships inside
the package and is reachable from Settings › About) from the app's package graph, and copies it next to the `.msix` so
the release can attach it and the attribution is readable without unpacking. Regenerate it whenever a
`PackageReference` is added or removed.

The manifest declares the `wavee://` protocol handler and toast activation against the packaged identity — that is what
makes deep links and notification clicks activate the *installed* app rather than the unpackaged HKCU fallback, so
those two paths can only be smoke‑tested from an installed package.

**Wavee has no CI release job.** A CI checkout has no `src/apps/Wavee.PlayPlay` junction, so it would silently publish
the public‑only variant; releases are cut locally by `ops/release/wavee-release.ps1`, which bumps `<WaveeBuild>`, dates
the changelog, validates the notes, calls this script once per architecture, signs, tags, publishes, and repoints the
`wavee-stable` feed. See **`ops/release/README.md`** and the full runbook
**[`docs/guide/releasing-wavee.md`](../../docs/guide/releasing-wavee.md)**.

## CI / publish (`.github/workflows/msix.yml`)

Trigger: push a tag `v*`, or run the workflow manually. Flow:

1. **version** — derive the 4‑part MSIX version `X.Y.Z.<run-number>` (monotonic, so `.appinstaller` always updates).
2. **build** (matrix) — `x64` on `windows-latest`, `arm64` on `windows-11-arm`; each runs `pack-msix.ps1 -NoSign` (AOT
   can't cross‑compile, hence per‑arch runners). Uploads the unsigned `.msix`.
3. **sign** *(optional)* — runs only if the repo variable `TRUSTED_SIGNING_ACCOUNT` is set; signs both packages with
   **Azure Trusted Signing**.
4. **release** — generates a per‑arch `.appinstaller` and publishes a GitHub Release with the `.msix` + `.appinstaller`.

### Signing config (optional, for trusted public releases)

Set these repo **secrets** — `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` — and **variables** —
`TRUSTED_SIGNING_ACCOUNT`, `TRUSTED_SIGNING_ENDPOINT`, `TRUSTED_SIGNING_PROFILE`, and `RELEASE_PUBLISHER` (the cert
subject, which **must match** the package manifest `Publisher`). Without them, CI ships **unsigned** packages (install via
the local dev‑cert flow above). The `.appinstaller` `Publisher` must match the signed package exactly.
